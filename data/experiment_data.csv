GSE14764,A Prognostic Gene Expression Index in Ovarian Cancer,"Ovarian carcinoma has the highest mortality rate among gynecological malignancies. In this project, we investigated the hypothesis that molecular markers are able to predict outcome of ovarian cancer independently of classical clinical predictors, and that these molecular markers can be validated using independent data sets.   We applied a semi-supervised method for prediction of patient survival. Microarrays from a cohort of 80 ovarian carcinomas (TOC cohort) were used for the development of a predictive model, which was then evaluated in an entirely independent cohort of 118 carcinomas (Duke cohort).  A 300 gene ovarian prognostic index (OPI) was generated and validated in a leave-one-out approach in the TOC cohort (Kaplan-Meier analysis, p=0.0087). In a second validation step the prognostic power of the OPI was confirmed in an independent data set (Duke cohort, p=0.0063). In multivariate analysis, the OPI was independent of the postoperative residual tumour, the main clinico-pathological prognostic parameter with an adjusted hazard ratio of 6.4 (TOC cohort, CI 1.8 – 23.5, p=0.0049) and 1.9 (Duke cohort, CI 1.2 – 3.0, p=0.0068). We constructed a combined score of molecular data (OPI) and clinical parameters (residual tumour), which was able to define patient groups with highly significant differences in survival.  The integrated analysis of gene expression data as well as residual tumour can be used for optimised assessment of prognosis. As traditional treatment options are limited, this analysis may be able to optimise clinical management and to identify those patients that would be candidates for new therapeutic strategies.

GSE23554,Ovarian Cancer Dataset,"Background. Genome-wide expression changes are associated with development of chemoresistance in patients with ovarian cancer (OVCA); the BCL2 antagonist of cell death (BAD) apoptosis pathway may play a role in clinical outcome.
Methods.  We analyzed specimens and/or genomic data from 1,406 patients and 116 cancer cell lines.  Genome-wide expression changes and cisplatin-resistance were evaluated in OVCA cell lines subjected to a total of 144 (cisplatin)-treatment/recovery cycles. Pathway analysis was performed on genes associated with increasing cisplatin-resistance.  BAD protein phosphorylation was studied in patient samples and cell lines, and small interfering RNAs (siRNA) used to explore the pathway as a therapeutic target. We evaluated the influence of BAD-pathway expression on chemosensitivity and/or clinical outcome using genomic data from 60 human cancer cell lines and ovarian, breast, colon, and brain cancers from 1,258 patients.
Results.  The BAD pathway was associated with evolution of OVCA cell line cisplatin-resistance (P<0.001) and resistance of 7 human cancer cell types to 8 cytotoxic agents (P<0.05).  OVCA chemoresistance was associated with BAD protein phosphorylation, and targeted siRNA modulation produced corresponding changes in chemosensitivity. Expression of a 47-gene BAD-pathway signature was associated with survival of 1,258 patients with ovarian, breast, colon, and brain cancer.  The OVCA BAD-pathway signature survival advantage was independent of surgical cytoreductive status.
Conclusions.  The BAD apoptosis pathway influences the sensitivity of human cancers to a variety of chemotherapies, likely via modulation of BAD-phosphorylation.  The pathway has clinical relevance as a potential biomarker of therapeutic response, patient survival, and as a promising therapeutic target.",Twenty-eight (28) advanced-stage serous epithelial ovarian cancers were resected at the time of primary surgery from patients who would receive platinum-based therapy.

GSE23720,High-resolution comparative genomic hybridization of inflammatory breast cancer and identification of candidate genes,"Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is an aggressive form of BC poorly defined at the molecular level. We compared the molecular portraits of 63 IBC and 134 non-IBC (nIBC) clinical samples. Genomic imbalances of 49 IBCs and 124 nIBCs were determined using high-resolution array-comparative genomic hybridization, and mRNA expression profiles of 197 samples using whole-genome microarrays. Genomic profiles of IBCs were as heterogeneous as those of nIBCs, and globally relatively close. However, IBCs showed more frequent “complex” patterns and a higher percentage of genes with CNAs per sample. The number of altered regions was similar in both types, although some regions were altered more frequently and/or with higher amplitude in IBCs. Many genes were similarly altered in both types; however, more genes displayed recurrent amplifications in IBCs.","Pre-treatment tumor tissues were collected from 197 patients with invasive adenocarcinomas. Patients underwent surgical biopsies or initial surgery at the Institut Paoli-Calmettes (IPC, Marseille, France) between 1987 and 2007. Each patient gave written informed consent and the study was approved by the IPC “Comité d’Orientation Stratégique”. Tumor samples were macrodissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen within 30 minutes of removal. Before RNA extraction, tumor sections were reviewed by two pathologists and contained more than 60% of tumor cells.

Its expression and prognostic value have never been explored in breast cancer. Using DNA microarray,  we examined ECRG4 mRNA expression in 353 invasive breast cancer samples. A meta-analysis was performed on a large public retrospective gene expression dataset (n=1,387) to analyze correlation between ECRG4 expression and histo-clinical features including survival.","To determine ECRG4 mRNA expression in breast cancer and normal breast, we first analyzed gene expression data generated by our laboratory (Institut Paoli Calmettes (IPC), Marseille, France) from cancer and normal mammary samples. Tumor tissues were from 353 patients with invasive adenocarcinoma who underwent initial surgery at IPC between 1987 and 2007. The study was approved by our institutional review board. Each patient gave a written informed consent for research use. Samples were macrodissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen within 30 min of surgical removal. All profiled specimens contained more than 60% of cancer cells (as assessed before RNA extraction using frozen sections adjacent to the profiled samples). After surgery, patients received an adjuvant multimodal treatment according to standard guidelines. Extraction of nucleic acids from frozen samples was done by using guanidium isothiocynanate and cesium chloride gradient.

GSE41998,Biomarker analysis of neoadjuvant Doxorubicin/Cyclophosphamide followed by Ixabepilone or Paclitaxel in early-stage breast cancer,"A randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase II trial (NCT00455533) enrolled previously untreated women with histologically-confirmed primary invasive breast adenocarcinoma (T2–3, N0–3, M0, tumor size ≥2.0 cm), regardless of hormone receptor or HER2 expression status. Patients received sequential neoadjuvant therapy starting with 4 cycles of AC (doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 intravenously and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 intravenously) given every 3 weeks, followed by 1:1 randomization to either ixabepilone (40 mg/m2 3-hour infusion) every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, or paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 1-hour infusion) weekly for 12 weeks.
Fresh tumor biopsies at screening were a mandatory prerequisite for study entry for biomarker analyses. Gene expression profiling was performed by Affymetrix GeneChip to determine if pre-specified gene models could distinguish between the clinical activity of two microtubule stabilizing agents, ixabepilone and paclitaxel.","Three core needle tumor tissue biopsies were obtained from all subjects before neoadjuvant therapy with AC and immediately combined in RNAlater® solution for subsequent RNA extraction, cRNA labeling and gene expression profiling.  Pre-specified gene models were tested for their capacity to distinguish pathologic complete response rates between the AC followed by ixabepilone versus the AC followed by paclitaxel treatment regimens.

GSE42363,Exome and whole genome sequencing of esophageal adenocarcinoma identifies recurrent driver events and mutational complexity,"The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has risen 600% over the last 30 years.  With an extremely poor five-year survival rate of only 15%, identification of new therapeutic targets for EAC is of great importance. Here, we analyze the mutation spectra from the whole exome sequencing of 149 EAC tumors/normal pairs, 15 of which have also been subjected to whole genome sequencing. We identify a novel mutational signature in EACs defined by a high prevalence of A to C transversions at Ap*A dinucleotides. Statistical analysis of the exome data identified 26 genes that are mutated at a significant frequency. Of these 26 genes, only four (TP53, CDKN2A, SMAD4, and PIK3CA) have been previously implicated in EAC. The novel significantly mutated genes include several chromatin modifying factors and candidate contributors to EAC: SPG20, TLR4, ELMO1, and DOCK2.   Notably, functional analyses of EAC-derived mutations in ELMO1 increase cellular invasion. Therefore, we suggest a new hypothesis about the potential activation of the RAC1 pathway to be a contributor to EAC tumorigenesis.","The study aimed to analyze 150 primary, human esophageal adenocarcinoma samples by whole genome and whole exome sequencing (which will be deposited to dbGAP following the TCGA practice).  RNA expression data was used to determine gene expression in 14 of the samples analyzed by whole genome sequencing. No normals were analyzed.",,14,GPL570,0
GSE62080,"Gene expression signature in advanced colorectal cancer patients select drugs and response for the use of leucovorin, fluorouracil, and irinotecan","In patients with advanced colorectal cancer, leucovorin, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) is considered as one of the reference first-line treatments. However, only about half of treated patients respond to this regimen, and there is no clinically useful marker that predicts response. A major clinical challenge is to identify the subset of patients who could benefit from this chemotherapy. We aimed to identify a gene expression profile in primary colon cancer tissue that could predict chemotherapy response.  Patients and Methods:- Tumor colon samples from 21 patients with advanced colorectal cancer were analyzed for gene expression profiling using Human Genome GeneChip arrays U133. At the end of the first-line treatment, the best observed response, according to WHO criteria, was used to define the responders and nonresponders. Discriminatory genes were first selected by the significance analysis of microarrays algorithm and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. A predictor classifier was then constructed using support vector machines. Finally, leave-one-out cross validation was used to estimate the performance and the accuracy of the output class prediction rule. Results:- We determined a set of 14 predictor genes of response to FOLFIRI. Nine of nine responders (100% specificity) and 11 of 12 nonresponders (92% sensitivity) were classified correctly, for an overall accuracy of 95%. Conclusion:- After validation in an independent cohort of patients, our gene signature could be used as a decision tool to assist oncologists in selecting colorectal cancer patients who could benefit from FOLFIRI chemotherapy, both in the adjuvant and the first-line metastatic setting.","All tissue samples were maintained at −180°C (liquid nitrogen) until RNA extraction and were weighed before homogenization. Tissue samples were then disrupted directly into a lysis buffer using Mixer Mill MM 300 (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Total RNA was isolated from tissue lysates using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), and additional DNAse digestion was performed on all samples during the extraction process (RNase-Free DNase Set Protocol for DNase treatment on RNeasy Mini Spin Columns; Qiagen). After each extraction, a small fraction of the total RNA preparation was taken to determine the quality of the sample and the yield of total RNA.

GSE63885,Gene expression profiling in ovarian cancer,"The introduction of microarray techniques to cancer research brought great expectations for finding biomarkers that would improve patients’ treatment; however, the results of such studies are poorly reproducible and critical analyses of these methods are rare. In this study, we examined global gene expression in 97 ovarian cancer samples. Also, validation of results by quantitative RT-PCR was performed on 30 additional ovarian cancer samples. We carried out a number of systematic analyses in relation to several defined clinicopathological features. The main goal of our study was to delineate the molecular background of ovarian cancer chemoresistance and find biomarkers suitable for prediction of patients’ prognosis. We found that histological tumor type was the major source of variability in genes expression, except for serous and undifferentiated tumors that showed nearly identical profiles. Analysis of clinical endpoints [tumor response to chemotherapy, overall survival, disease-free survival (DFS)] brought results that were not confirmed by validation either on the same group or on the independent group of patients. CLASP1 was the only gene that was found to be important for DFS in the independent group, whereas in the preceding experiments it showed associations with other clinical endpoints and with BRCA1 gene mutation; thus, it may be worthy of further testing. Our results confirm that histological tumor type may be a strong confounding factor and we conclude that gene expression studies of ovarian carcinomas should be performed on histologically homogeneous groups. Among the reasons of poor reproducibility of statistical results may be the fact that despite relatively large patients’ group, in some analyses one has to compare small and unequal classes of samples. In addition, arbitrarily performed division of samples into classes compared may not always reflect their true biological diversity. And finally, we think that clinical endpoints of the tumor probably depend on subtle changes in many and, possibly, alternative molecular pathways, and such changes may be difficult to demonstrate.","Here, we provide gene expression data from 101 ovarian cancer surgical samples: 73 serous, 12 endometrioid, 9 clear cell and 7 undifferentiated.   The majority of patients (98 out of 101) were tested for BRCA1 gene mutation: 27 patients had germline BRCA1 gene mutation, one had somatic mutation, 70 had no BRCA1 mutation detected.   We also checked for somatic TP53 gene mutation: 75 tumors had somatic mutation in TP53, 15 had no mutation detected, 11 were not analyzed (NA). The p53 protein accumulation in the cancer cells was analyzed by immunohistochemistry: 54 tumors had protein accumulation, 42 had no accumulation, 5 - NA.   For 75 samples we provide extensive pathological and clinical data: tumor grade, histological type, FIGO stage, disease free survival time (DFS), overall survival (OS), residual tumor size (R), clinical status post first-line chemotherapy and at last follow-up, platinum sensitivity.

GSE92697,caArray_vince-00013: Integrated Genomics and Transcriptomic Analyses of Ductal Carcinoma In situ of the Breast,"Purpose: To gain insight into genomic and trancriptomic subtypes of ductal carcinomas in situ of the breast (DCIS).
Results: Thirty-two DCIS exhibited a luminal phenotype; 21were ERBB2 positive, and 4 were ERBB2/estrogen receptor (ER) negativewith1harboring a bona fide basal-like phenotype.Based on a CGHanalysis, genomic types were identified in this series of DCISwith the 1q gain/16q loss combination observed in 3 luminal DCIS, themixed amplifier pattern including all ERBB2,12 luminal and 1ERBB2/ER- DCIS, and the complex copy number alteration profile encompassing 14 luminal and 1ERBB2/ER- DCIS. Eight cases (8 of 57; 14%) presented aTP53 mutation, all being amplifiers. Unsupervised analysis of gene expression profiles of 26 of the 57 DCIS showed that luminal and ERBB2-amplified, ER-negative cases clustered separately.We further investigated the effect of high and low copy number changes on gene expression. Strikingly, amplicons but also low copy number changes especially on 1q, 8q, and 16q in DCIS regulated the expression of a subset of genes in a very similar way to that recently described in invasive ductal carcinomas.
Conclusions: These combined approaches show that the molecular heterogeneity of breast ductal carcinomas exists already in in situ lesions and further indicate that DCIS and invasive ductal carcinomas share genomic alterations with a similar effect on  gene expression profile.","Experimental Design: We did a combined phenotypic and genomic analysis of a series of 57 DCIS integrated with gene expression profile analysis for 26 of the 57 cases.

GSE22513,Markers of Taxane Sensitivity in Breast Cancer,"The purpose of this study was to identify molecular markers of pathologic response to neoadjuvant paclitaxel/radiation treatment, protein and gene expression profiling were done on pretreatment biopsies.  Patients with high-risk, operable breast cancer were treated with three cycles of paclitaxel followed by concurrent paclitaxel/radiation. Tumor tissue from pretreatment biopsies was obtained from 19 of the 38 patients enrolled in the study. Protein and gene expression profiling were done on serial sections of the biopsies from patients that achieved a pathologic complete response (pCR) and compared to those with residual disease, non-pCR (NR).  Proteomic and validation immunohistochemical analyses revealed that α-defensins (DEFA) were overexpressed in tumors from patients with a pCR. Gene expression analysis revealed that MAP2, a microtubule-associated protein, had significantly higher levels of expression in patients achieving a pCR. Elevation of MAP2 in breast cancer cell lines led to increased paclitaxel sensitivity. Furthermore, expression of genes that are associated with the basal-like, triple-negative phenotype were enriched in tumors from patients with a pCR. Analysis of a larger panel of tumors from patients receiving presurgical taxane-based treatment showed that DEFA and MAP2 expression as well as histologic features of inflammation were all statistically associated with response to therapy at the time of surgery.  We show the utility of molecular profiling of pretreatment biopsies to discover markers of response. Our results suggest the potential use of immune signaling molecules such as DEFA as well as MAP2, a microtubule-associated protein, as tumor markers that associate with response to neoadjuvant taxane–based therapy.","Tumor tissues from pretreatment needle biopsies from patients enrolled on a paclitaxel/radiation clinical trial were laser capture microdissected for RNA extraction and hybridization to Affymetrix microarrays.

After a baseline tumor core biopsy, patients were randomized to receive anastrozole and fulvestrant (AF) or anastrozole, fulvestrant, and gefitinib (AFG) for 3 weeks.  After a second biopsy at 3 weeks, all patients received AFG for 4 months and surgery was done if the tumor was operable. The primary endpoint was best clinical response by RECIST criteria and secondary endpoints were toxicity and change in biomarkers.

We conducted an unsupervised analysis of microarray gene-expression profiles of 107 TN breast cancer patients and undertook robust functional annotation of the molecular entities found by means of numerous approaches including immunohistochemistry and gene-expression signatures. An 87 TN external cohort was used for validation.
Fuzzy clustering separated TN tumours into three clusters: C1 (22.4%), C2 (44.9%) and C3 (32.7%). C1 patients were older (mean = 64.6 years) than C2 (mean = 56.8 years; P = 0.03) and C3 patients (mean = 51.9 years; P = 0.0004). Histological grade and Nottingham prognostic index were higher in C2 and C3 than in C1 (P < 0.0001 for both comparisons). Significant event-free survival (EFS) (P = 0.03) was found according to cluster membership: patients belonging to C3 had a better outcome than patients in C1 (P = 0.01) and C2 (P = 0.02). EFS analysis results were confirmed when our cohort was pooled with external cohort (n = 194; P = 0.01). Functional annotation showed that 22% of TN patients were not basal-like (C1). C1 was enriched in luminal subtypes and positive androgen receptor (luminal androgen receptor [LAR]). C2 could be considered as an almost pure basal-like cluster. C3, enriched in basal-like subtypes, but to a lesser extent, included 26% of claudin-low subtypes. Dissection of immune response showed that high immune response (HIR) and low M2-like macrophages were a hallmark of C3, and that these patients had a better EFS than C2 patients, characterized by low immune response (LIR) and high M2-like macrophages: P = 0.02 for our cohort, and P = 0.03 for pooled cohorts. 
We identified 3 subtypes of TN patients: LAR (22%), basal-like with LIR and high M2-like macrophages (45%) and basal-enriched with HIR and low M2-like macrophages (33%).

GSE21653,A gene expression signature identifies two prognostic subgroups of basal breast cancer,"Medullary breast cancers (MBC) display a basal profile, but a favorable prognosis. We hypothesized that a previously published 368-gene expression signature associated with MBC might serve to define a prognostic classifier in basal cancers. We collected public gene expression and histoclinical data of 2145 invasive early breast adenocarcinomas. We developed a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier based on this 368-gene list in a learning set, and tested its predictive performances in an independent validation set. Then, we assessed its prognostic value and that of six prognostic signatures for disease-free survival (DFS) in the remaining 2034 samples. The SVM model accurately classified all MBC samples in the learning and validation sets. A total of 466 cases were basal across other sets. The SVM classifier separated them into two subgroups, subgroup 1 (resembling MBC) and subgroup 2 (not resembling MBC). Subgroup 1 exhibited 71% 5-year DFS, whereas subgroup 2 exhibited 50% (p=9.93E-05). The classifier outperformed the classical prognostic variables in multivariate analysis, conferring lesser risk for relapse in subgroup 1 (HR=0.52, p=3.9E-04).

GSE11001,Genome-wide expression profiling from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast cancer core biopsies,"The routine workflow for invasive cancer diagnostics is based on biopsy processing by formalin fixation and subsequent paraffin embedding. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples are easy to handle, stable and particularly suitable for morphologic evaluation, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. However, it has become a paradigm that these samples cannot be used for genome-wide expression analysis with microarrays. To oppose this view, we present a pilot microarray study using FFPE core needle biopsies from breast cancers as RNA source.  We found that microarray probes interrogating sequences near the poly-A-tail of the transcribed genes were well suitable to measure RNA levels in FFPE core needle biopsies. For the ER and the HER2 gene, we observed strong correlations between RNA levels measured in these probe sets and protein expression determined by immunohistochemistry (p = 0.000003 and p = 0.0022). Further, we have identified a signature of 364 genes that correlated with ER protein status and a signature of 528 genes that correlated with HER2 protein status. Many of these genes (ER: 60%) could be confirmed by analysis of an independent publicly available data set. Finally, a hierarchical clustering of the biopsies with respect to three recently reported gene expression grade signatures resulted in widely stable low and high expression grade clusters that correlated with the pathological tumor grade.  These findings support the notion that clinically relevant information can be gained from microarray based gene expression profiling of FFPE cancer biopsies. This opens new opportunities for the integration of gene expression analysis into the workflow of invasive cancer diagnostics as well as translational research in the setting of clinical studies.

GSE16391,GGI: a potential predictor of relapse for endocrine-treated breast cancer patients in the BIG 1-98 trial,"Background: We have previously shown that the Gene expression Grade Index (GGI) was able to identify two subtypes of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors that were associated with statistically distinct clinical outcomes in both untreated and tamoxifen-treated patients. Here, we aim to investigate the ability of the GGI to predict relapses in postmenopausal women who were treated with tamoxifen (T) or letrozole (L) within the BIG 1-98 trial. 
Methods: We generated gene expression profiles (Affymetrix) and computed the GGI for a matched, case-control sample of patients enrolled in the BIG 1-98 trial from the two hospitals where frozen samples were available. All relapses (cases) were identified from patients randomized to receive monotherapy or from the switching treatment arms for whom relapse occurred before the switch.  Each case was randomly matched with four controls based upon nodal status and treatment (T or L).  The prognostic value of GGI was assessed as a continuous predictor and divided at the median.  Predictive accuracy of GGI was estimated using time-dependent area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curves. 
Results:  Frozen samples were analyzable for 48 patients (10 cases and 38 controls).  Seven of the 10 cases had been assigned to receive L. Cases and controls were comparable with respect to menopausal and nodal status, local and chemotherapy, and HER2 positivity. Cases were slightly older than controls and had a larger proportion of large, poorly differentiated ER+/PgR- tumors.  The GGI was significantly and linearly related to risk of relapse: each 10-unit increase in GGI resulted in an increase of approximately 11% in the hazard rate (p=0.02).  Within the subgroups of patients with node-positive disease or who were treated with L, the hazard of relapse was significantly greater for patients with GGI at or above the median. AUC reached a maximum of 78% at 27 months.
Conclusions: This analysis supports the GGI as a good predictor of relapse for ER-positive patients, even among patients who receive L.  Validation of these results, in a larger series from BIG 1-98, is planned using the simplified GGI represented by a smaller set of genes and tested by qRT-PCR on paraffin-embedded tissues.

To elucidate molecular characteristics of lung adenocarcinomas (ADCs) with ALK mutations and those without EGFR, KRAS and ALK mutations, 226 primary lung ADCs of pathological stage I-II, examined for the status of EGFR, KRAS and ALK mutations, were subjected to genome-wide expression profiling, and genes up-regulated in lung ADCs with ALK mutations and those without EGFR, KRAS and ALK mutations were identified.  One hundred and seventy-four genes, including ALK, were selected as being up-regulated specifically in 79 lung ADCs without EGFR and KRAS mutations.  These 79 cases were divided into:  11 cases of ALK-positive ADCs, 36 cases of group A triple-negative ADCs, and 32 cases of group B triple-negative ADCs, by unsupervised clustering according to the expression of the 174 genes.  In ALK-positive ADCs, 30 genes, including ALK itself and GRIN2A, were significantly overexpressed.  Group A triple-negative ADC cases showed significantly worse prognoses for relapse and death than ADC cases with EGFR, KRAS or ALK mutations and group B triple-negative ADC cases.  Nine genes were identified as being significantly up-regulated in group A triple-negative ADC cases and critical for predicting their prognosis.  The nine genes included DEPDC1, which had been identified as a candidate diagnostic and therapeutic target in bladder and breast cancers.

The goal of this study is to test the feasibility of developing lung cancer prognosis gene signatures using genome-wide expression profiling of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, which are widely available and provide a valuable rich source for studying the association of molecular changes in cancer and associated clinical outcomes. FFPE tumor specimens were collected, and total RNA was processed for analysis on the Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 arrays according to Affymetrix protocols.  The quality control procedure for microarray data analysis was based on the percentage of present calls calculated by the MAS5 package. We selected 55 arrays with at least 15% of probe sets present, and we selected 1400 probe sets that present on all 55 arrays for data analysis. After microarray analysis QC, we used the RMA background correction algorithm to remove non-specific background  noise. A robust regression model was fitted to the probe level data, and the fitted expression values for the probes at the 3' end were used to summarize the probe set expression values.  Quantile-quantile normalization was used to normalize all the arrays. The 55 samples and the derived gene expression values for 1400 genes based on the robust regression model were used to develop gene signatures and were uploaded as supplementary data (GSE29013_fitted_1400_probes.txt).","We micro dissected tumor area from FFPE specimen, and used Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 arrays to obtain gene expression data.",,55,GPL570,0
GSE37745,"Biomarker discovery in non-small cell lung cancer: integrating gene expression profiling, meta-analysis and tissue microarray validation","Background: Global gene expression profiling has been widely used in lung cancer research to identify clinically relevant molecular subtypes as well as to predict prognosis and therapy response. So far, the value of these multi-gene signatures in clinical practice is unclear and the biological importance of individual genes is difficult to assess as the published signatures virtually do not overlap.

Methods: Here we describe a novel single institute cohort, including 196 non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) cases with clinical information and long-term follow-up, which was used as a training set to screen for single genes with prognostic impact. The top 450 gene probe sets identified using a univariate Cox regression model (significance level p<0.01) were tested in a meta-analysis including five publicly available independent lung cancer cohorts (n=860).

Results: The meta-analysis revealed that 17 probe sets were significantly associated with survival (p<0.0005) with a false discovery rate of 1%. The prognostic impact of one of these genes, the cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1), was confirmed by use of immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray including 355 NSCLC samples. Low CADM1 protein expression was associated with shorter survival (p=0.028), with particular influence in the adenocarcinoma patient subgroup (p=0.002).

Conclusions: We were able to validate single genes with independent prognostic impact using a novel NSCLC cohort together with a meta-analysis approach.

We posited that a gene expression signature capable of discerning tumors of grade I (G1) and grade III (G3) histology might provide a more objective measure of grade with prognostic benefit for patients with moderately differentiated disease. To this end, we studied the expression profiles of 347 primary invasive breast tumors analyzed on Affymetrix microarrays. Using class prediction algorithms, we identified 264 robust grade-associated markers, six of which could accurately classify G1 and G3 tumors, and separate G2 tumors into two highly discriminant classes (termed G2a and G2b genetic grades) with patient survival outcomes highly similar to those with G1 and G3 histology, respectively. Statistical analysis of conventional clinical variables further distinguished G2a and G2b subtypes from each other, but also from histologic G1 and G3 tumors. In multivariate analyses, genetic grade was consistently found to be an independent prognostic indicator of disease recurrence comparable to that of lymph node status and tumor size. When incorporated into the Nottingham Prognostic Index, genetic grade enhanced detection of patients with less harmful tumors, likely to benefit little from adjuvant therapy. Our findings show that a genetic grade signature can improve prognosis and therapeutic planning for breast cancer patients, and support the view that low and high grade disease, as defined genetically, reflect independent pathobiological entities rather than a continuum of cancer progression. Three separate breast cancer cohorts were analyzed: 1) Uppsala (n=249), 2) Stockholm (n=58), 3) Singapore (n=40). The Uppsala and Singapore data can be accessed here.

Gene expression profiling employing Affymetrix GeneChips (U133A) was performed in 220 mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas, including a core group of eight Burkitt lymphomas, which fulfilled all diagnostic criteria of the WHO classification. A molecular signature of Burkitt lymphoma was generated. Chromosomal abnormalities were detected by interphase fluorescence in-situ hybridization and array comparative genomic hybridization. The molecular Burkitt lymphoma signature identified 44 cases. Fifteen of these cases lacked a morphology typical for Burkitt/Burkitt-like lymphoma. The vast majority (88%) of the 176 lymphomas without the molecular Burkitt lymphoma signature represented diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. In 20% of these cases a MYC break was detectable which was associated with complex chromosomal changes. Our molecular definition of Burkitt lymphoma sharpens and extends the spectrum of Burkitt lymphoma. In mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas without a Burkitt lymphoma signature, a chromosomal break in the MYC locus proved to be associated with adverse clinical outcome.

GSE33072,An epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) gene signature predicts resistance to erlotinib and PI3K pathway inhibitors and identifies Axl as a novel EMT marker in non-small cell lung cancer.,"Epithelial/mesenchymal transition (EMT) is associated with loss of cell adhesion molecules, such as E-cadherin, and increased invasion, migration, and proliferation in epithelial cancers. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), EMT is associated with greater resistance to EGFR inhibitors. However, its potential to predict response to other targeted drugs or chemotherapy has not been well characterized. The goal of this study was to develop a robust, platform-independent EMT gene expression signature and to investigate the association of EMT and drug response in NSCLC.
A 76-gene EMT signature was derived in 54 DNA-fingerprinted NSCLC cell lines and tested in an independent set of cell lines and in NSCLC patients from the BATTLE clinical trial.  The signature classified cell lines as epithelial or mesenchymal independent of the microarray platform and correlated strongly with E-cadherin protein levels, as measured by reverse phase protein array.  Higher protein expression of Rab25 (in epithelial lines) and Axl (in mesenchymal lines), two signature genes associated with in EMT in other cancer types, was also confirmed. Mesenchymal cell lines demonstrated significantly greater resistance to EGFR inhibition, independent of EGFR mutation status and were more resistant to drugs targeting the PI3K/Akt pathway. We observed no association between EMT and response to cytotoxic chemotherapies, including cisplatin, pemetrexed, and docetaxel monotherapy and/or doublets (p-values ≥0.2).  In NSCLC patients, the EMT signature predicted 8-week disease control in the erlotinib arm, but not in other treatment arms.  In conclusion, we have developed a robust EMT signature that predicts resistance to EGFR inhibitors and PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitors.",Gene expression profiles were measured in 131 core biopsies from patients with refractory non-small cell lung cancer in the  Biomarker-integrated Approaches of Targeted Therapy for Lung Cancer Elimination (BATTLE) trial.

GSE31852,An EGFR-mutation signature reveals features of the EGFR-dependent phenotype and identifies MACC1 as an EGFR-associated regulator of MET.,"EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancers bear hallmarks including sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors,  and low proliferation, and increased MET.  However, the biology of EGFR dependence is still poorly understood. Using a training cohort of chemo-naive lung adenocarcinomas, we have developed a 72-gene signature that predicts (i) EGFR mutation status in four independent datasets; (ii) sensitivity to erlotinib in vitro; and (iii) improved survival, even in the wild-type EGFR subgroup. The signature includes differences associated with enhanced receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, such as increased expression of endocytosis-related genes, decreased phosphatase levels, decreased expression of proliferation-related genes, increased folate receptor-1 (FOLR1) (a determinant of pemetrexed response), and higher levels of MACC1 (which we identify as a regulator of MET in EGFR-mutant NSCLC).  Those observations provide evidence that the EGFR-mutant phenotype is associated with alterations in the cellular machinery that links the EGFR and MET pathways and create a permissive environment for RTK signaling.
We have developed a gene expression signature that predicts (i) EGFR mutation in chemo-naive and, to a lesser extent, in chemo-refractory NSCLC patients; (ii) EGFR TKI response in vitro; and (iii) survival in wild-type EGFR patients. The signature also identifies novel features of EGFR mutant NSCLC including increased levels of endocytosis-related genes and MACC1, which appears be an EGFR mutant associated regulator of MET.","Gene expression profiles were measured in 124 core biopsies from patients with refractory non-small cell lung cancer in the  Biomarker-integrated Approaches of Targeted Therapy for Lung Cancer Elimination (BATTLE) trial.

GSE16446,Multifactorial Approach to Predicting Resistance to Anthracyclines,"PURPOSE: Validated biomarkers predictive of response/resistance to anthracyclines in breast cancer are currently lacking. The neoadjuvant TOP trial, in which patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors were treated with anthracycline (epirubicin) monotherapy, was specifically designed to evaluate the predictive value of topoisomerase IIα (TOP2A) and to develop a gene expression signature to identify those patients who do not benefit from anthracyclines.  

METHODS: The TOP trial included 149 patients, of which 141 were evaluable for response prediction analyses. The primary endpoint was pathological complete response (pCR). TOP2A and gene expression profiles were evaluated using pre-epirubicin biopsies. Gene expression data from ER-negative samples of the EORTC 10994/BIG 00-01 and MDACC 2003-0321 neoadjuvant trials were used for validation purposes.

RESULTS: A pCR was obtained in 14% of the evaluable TOP patients. TOP2A amplification, but not protein overexpression, was significantly associated with pCR (p=0.001 and 0.22). We developed an “anthracycline-based score (A-Score)” that combines three signatures: a TOP2A gene signature and two previously published signatures related to tumor invasion and immune response. The A-Score was characterized by a high negative predictive value (NPV=0.98 [95% CI: 0.90-1.00]) overall, and in the HER2-negative and HER2-positive subpopulations. Its performance was independently confirmed in the anthracycline-based (FAC/FEC) arms of the two validation trials (BIG 00-01: 0.80 [0.61-0.92] and MDACC 2003-0321: 1.00 [0.80-1.00]).

CONCLUSION: Given its high NPV, the A-Score could become, if further validated, a useful clinical tool to identify those patients who do not benefit from anthracyclines and could therefore be spared the non-negligible side effects.","Predicting the efficacy of anthracyclines (epirubicin) in breast cancer (BC) patients (TOP trial)

To date, no description of the characteristics of the plasma cells (PC) prone to achieve CR has been reported. This study aimed at the molecular characterization of PC derived from MM patients who achieved CR after bortezomib-thalidomide-dexamethasone (VTD) first line therapy.
One hundred and eighteen MM primary tumours obtained from homogeneously treated patients were globally profiled both for gene expression and for single nucleotide polymorphism genotype. Genomic results were used to obtain a predictor of sensitivity to VTD induction therapy, as well as to describe both the transcription and the genomic profile of PC derived from patients with MM who will respond optimally to primary induction therapy.
By analysing the gene profiles of CR patients, we identified a 5-gene signature predicting CR with an overall median accuracy of 75% (range: 72%-85%). In addition, we highlighted the differential expression of a series of genes, whose deregulation, accordingly to their reported functions, might explain the CR patients’ sensitivity to VTD therapy. We also showed that a small copy number loss, covering 606Kb on chromosome 1p22.1 was the most significantly associated with CR patients.
The study provides insights into the genomic landscape of PC obtained from newly diagnosed MM patients achieving CR after VTD and shows that patients might be accurately stratified according to their sensitivity to VTD.","118 samples have been analyzed; the homogeneity of samples has been ensured by the immunomagnetic enrichment procedure: only >90% pure CD138+ cells have been employed.

GSE32646,GSTP1 expression predicts poor pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in ER-negative breast cancer,"The purpose of the present study was to investigate the association of glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) expression with resistance to neoadjuvant paclitaxel followed by 5-fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (P-FEC) in human breast cancers. The relationship of GSTP1 expression and GSTP1 promoter hypermethylation with intrinsic subtypes was also investigated. In this study, primary breast cancer patients (n = 123, stage II-III) treated with neoadjuvant P-FEC were analyzed. Tumor samples were obtained by vacuum-assisted core biopsy before P-FEC. GSTP1 expression was determined using immunohistochemistry, GSTP1 promoter methylation index (MI) using bisulfite methylation assay and intrinsic subtypes using DNA microarray. The pathological complete response (pCR) rate was significantly higher in GSTP1-negative tumors (80.0%) than GSTP1-positive tumors (30.6%) (P = 0.009) among estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors but not among ER-positive tumors (P = 0.267). Multivariate analysis showed that GSTP1 was the only predictive factor for pCR (P = 0.013) among ER-negative tumors. Luminal A, luminal B and HER2-enriched tumors showed a significantly lower GSTP1 positivity than basal-like tumors (P = 0.002, P < 0.001 and P = 0.009, respectively), while luminal A, luminal B and HER2-enriched tumors showed a higher GSTP1 MI than basal-like tumors (P = 0.076, P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). In conclusion, these results suggest the possibility that GSTP1 expression can predict pathological response to P-FEC in ER-negative tumors but not in ER-positive tumors. Additionally, GSTP1 promoter hypermethylation might be implicated more importantly in the pathogenesis of luminal A, luminal B and HER2-enriched tumors than basal-like tumors.",Fresh frozen tumor samples obtained by vacuum-assisted core biopsy from one hundred and fifteen patients were subjected to RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.,,115,GPL570,0

However, there are no gene expression scores which are able to predict overall survival in CLL based on the expression of few genes that are better than established prognostic markers. We correlated 151 CLL microarray data sets with overall survival using Cox regression and supervised principal component analysis to derive a prognostic score. This score based on the expression levels of eight genes and was validated in an independent group of 149 CLL patients by quantitative real time PCR. The score was predictive for overall survival and time to treatment in univariate Cox regression in the validation data set (both: p<0.001) and in a multivariate analysis after adjustment for 17p and 11q deletions and the IgVH-status.

An extensive biomarker programme was prospectively planned to identify potential predictors of sensitivity to different treatments and evaluate treatment effect on tumor biomarkers.
A mutation in PIK3CA exon 20 or 9 was documented in 20% of the cases. Overall, the pCR rates were similar in PIK3CA wild type and PIK3CA mutated patients (33.3% vs 22.7%; p=0.323). However, for patients receiving trastuzumab plus lapatinib, the probability of pCR was higher in PIK3CA wild type tumors (48.4% vs 12.5%; p=0.06). Ki67, pAKT and apoptosis measured on the residual disease were significantly reduced from baseline. The degree of Ki67 inhibition was significantly higher in patients receiving the dual anti-HER2 blockade.

GSE39925,Transcriptional characterization of a prospective series of primary plasma cell leukemia revealed genes associated with tumor progression and poorest outcome,"Plasma cell leukemia (PCL) is a rare form of plasma cell dyscrasia that presents either as a progression of previously diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM), namely secondary PCL (sPCL), or as the initial manifestation of disease, namely primary PCL (pPCL). Although presenting signs and symptoms include those seen in MM, pPCL is characterized by several aspects that clearly define more aggressive course. To provide insights into the biology of pPCL, we have investigated the transcriptional profiles of a cohort of 21 newly-diagnosed, homogeneously treated pPCL patients included in a multicenter prospective clinical trial. All but one pPCL had one of the main IGH translocations, whose associated transcriptional signatures resembled those observed in MM. A 503-gene signature was identified that distinguished pPCL from MM, from which emerged 28 genes whose trend in expression levels was found associated with the progressive stages of plasma cell dyscrasia in a large dataset of cases from multiple institutions, including samples from normal donors throughout PCL. The transcriptional pattern of the pPCL series was then evaluated in association with outcome. Three genes were identified having expression levels correlated with response to the first-line treatment with lenalidomide/dexamethasone, whereas a 27-gene signature was identified associated with overall survival independently of molecular alterations, hematological parameters and renal function. Overall, our data contribute to a fine dissection of pPCL and may provide novel insights into the molecular definition of a subgroup of high-risk pPCL.","This series of microarray experiments contains the gene expression profiles of purified plasma cells (PCs) obtained from 21 pPCL and 55 MM at diagnosis. PCs were purified from bone marrow samples using CD138 immunomagnetic microbeads according to the manufacturer's instructions (MidiMACS system, Miltenyi Biotec); the purity of the positively selected PCs was assessed by morphology and flow cytometry and was > 90% in all cases. 5.5 micrograms of single-stranded DNA target obtained from 100 ng of purified total RNA was fragmented and then labeled using the WT Terminal Labeling Kit according to the standard Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip¨ Whole Transcript (WT) Sense Target Labeling Assay Manual).

GSE31519,A Clinically Relevant Gene Signature in Triple-Negative and Basal-Like Breast Cancer,"Current prognostic gene expression profiles for breast cancer mainly reflect proliferation status and are most useful in ER-positive cancers. Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are clinically heterogeneous, and prognostic markers and biology-based therapies are needed to better treat this disease.

We assembled Affymetrix gene expression data for 579 TNBCs and performed unsupervised analysis to define metagenes that distinguish molecular subsets within TNBC. We used n=394 cases for discovery and n=185 cases for validation. Sixteen metagenes emerged that identified basal-like, apocrine and claudin-low molecular subtypes, or reflected various non-neoplastic cell populations including immune cells, blood, adipocytes, stroma, angiogenesis, and inflammation within the cancer. The expressions of these metagenes were correlated with survival and multivariate analysis was performed including routine clinical and pathological variables.

73% of TNBCs displayed basal-like molecular subtype that correlated with high histological grade and younger age. Survival of basal-like TNBC was not different from non-basal-like TNBC. High expression of immune cell metagenes was associated with good and high expression of inflammation and angiogenesis-related metagenes were associated with poor prognosis. A ratio of high B-cell and low IL-8 metagenes identified 32% of TNBC with good prognosis (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22-0.61; P<0.001) and was the only significant predictor in multivariate analysis including routine clincopathological variables.

We describe a ratio of high B-cell presence and low IL-8 activity as a powerful new prognostic marker for TNBC.

GSE49019,HIV-1 gp120 impairs B cell proliferation by inducing TGF-β1 production and FcRL4 expression via an α4β7-dependent mechanism,"The anti-HIV humoral immune response following acute infection is delayed and ineffective. HIV envelope protein gp120 binds to and signals through α4β7 on T cells. We show that gp120 also binds and signals through α4β7 on B cells, resulting in an abortive proliferative response. In primary B cells, gp120 signaling through α4β7 resulted in increased expression of TGF-β1 and the B cell inhibitory receptor FcRL4. Co-culture of B cells with HIV-infected autologous CD4+ T cells also resulted in increased B cell FcRL4 expression. These findings indicate that, in addition to inducing chronic immune activation, viral proteins can contribute directly to HIV-associated B cell dysfunction, thus providing a mechanism whereby the virus subverts the early HIV-specific humoral immune response.",Forty-two samples in two batches were run with different treatments and different time points.,,42,GPL6244,0

GSE27389,Substitutions in the KRas oncogene determine protein behavior: Implications for signaling and clinical outcome.,"Mutant KRAS (mut-KRAS) is present in 30% of all human cancers and plays a critical role in cancer cell growth and resistance to therapy. There is evidence from colon cancer that mut-KRAS is a poor prognostic factor and negative predictor of patient response to molecularly targeted therapy.  However, evidence for such a relationship in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is conflicting.  KRAS mutations are primarily found at codons 12 and 13, where different base changes lead to alternate amino acid substitutions that lock the protein in an active state. The patterns of mut-KRas amino acid substitutions in colon cancer and NSCLC are quite different, with aspartate (D) predominating in colon cancer (50%) and cysteine (C) in NSCLC (47%).
Through an analysis of a recently completed biopsy biomarker-driven, molecularly targeted multi-arm trial of 215 evaluable patients with refractory NSCLC we show that mut-KRas-G12C/V but not total mut-KRAS predicts progression free survival for the overall group, and for the sorafenib and vandetanib treatment arms. Transcriptome microarray data shows differential expression of cell cycle genes between mut-KRas-G12C/V and G12D patient tumors.  A panel of NSCLC cell lines with known mut-KRas amino acid substitutions was used to identify pathways activated by the different mut-KRas, showing that mut-KRas-G12D activates both PI-3-K and MEK signaling, while mut-KRas G12C does not, and alternatively activates RAL signaling. This finding was confirmed using immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells stably transfected with wt-KRAS and different forms of mut-KRAS.  Molecular modeling studies show that the different conformation imposed by mut-KRas-G12C could lead to altered association with downstream signaling transducers compared to wild type and mut-KRas-G12D. The significance of the findings for developing mut-KRAS therapies is profound, since it suggests that not all mut-KRas amino acid substitutions signal to effectors in a similar way, and may require different therapeutic interventions.","Gene expression profiles were measured in 22 core biopsies from patients with refractory non-small cell lung cancer included in the  Biomarker-integrated Approaches of Targeted Therapy for Lung Cancer Elimination (BATTLE). All tumors were KRAS mutants, but with different patterns of amino acid substitutions. Supervised analysis of transcriptome profiling was performed to compare cysteine or valine KRAS mutants with other KRAS mutants.",,22,GPL6244,0

GSE75311,Expression changes in Melanomas pre MAPKi treatment vs. on MAPKi treatment (Affymetrix),"Treatment of advanced V600BRAF mutant melanoma using a BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) or its combination with a MEKi typically elicits partial responses. We compared the transcriptomes of patient-derived tumors regressing on MAPKi therapy against MAPKi-induced temporal transcriptomic states in human melanoma cell lines or murine melanoma in immune-competent mice. Despite heterogeneous dynamics of clinical tumor regression, residual tumors displayed highly recurrent transcriptomic alterations and enriched processes, which were also observed in MAPKi-selected cell lines (implying tumor cell-intrinsic reprogramming) or in bulk mouse tumors (and the CD45-negative or -positive fractions,, implying tumor cell-intrinsic or stromal/immune alterations, respectively). Tumor cell-intrinsic reprogramming attenuated MAPK-dependency, while enhancing mesenchymal, angiogenic and IFN-inflammatory features and growth/survival dependence on multi-RTKs and PD-L2. In the immune compartment, PD-L2 upregulation in CD11c+ immunocytes drove the loss of T-cell inflammation and promoted BRAFi resistance. Thus, residual melanoma early on MAPKi therapy already displays potentially exploitable adaptive transcriptomic, epigenomic, immune-regulomic alterations.",Melanoma biopsies pre and on MAPKi treatment were sent for transcriptomic analysis using Affymetrix HuGene 1.0 microarray,SubSeries of: GSE75313,6,GPL6244,0

GSE36221,Airway gene expression is dynamic with corticosteroid treatment and reflects disease activity,"Introduction: In the recently completed Dutch GLUCOLD study, treatment of COPD patients with fluticasone ± salmeterol reduced the rate of decline in FEV1. These results indicate that ICS can have therapeutic efficacy in COPD. Aim: To explore the molecular mechanisms by which ICS exert their effects, we performed genome-wide gene expression profiling on bronchial biopsies from COPD patients who participated in the GLUCOLD study. Methods: An Affymetrix Human Gene Array ST version 1.0 was performed in a total of 221 bronchial biopsies that were available from 90 COPD patients at baseline and after 6 and 30 months of therapy. Linear mixed effects modeling was used to analyze treatment-specific changes in gene expression. A validation set was included and pathway analysis was performed with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Results: The expression of 138 genes significantly decreased after both 6 and 30 months of treatment with fluticasone ± salmeterol versus placebo, whereas the expression of 140 genes increased. A more pronounced treatment-induced change in expression of 51 of these 278 genes was associated with a slower rate of decline in FEV1. Genes that decreased with treatment were involved in pathways related to cell cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, epithelial cell signaling, p53 signaling and T cell signaling. Genes that increased with treatment were involved in pathways related to focal adhesion, gap junction and extracellular matrix deposition. Conclusion: The present study suggests that gene expression in biological pathways of COPD is dynamic with treatment and reflects disease activity. This study opens the gate to targeted and phenotype-driven therapy of COPD.","First, a total of 162 samples were analysed  (RNA derived from bronchial biopsies from COPD patients before and after treatment with fluticasone +/- salmeterol or placebo [GLUCOLD study]), 107 samples before and after 6 and 30 months of treatment with fluticasone +/- salmeterol and 55 samples before and after treatment with placebo. A total of 278 genes were found that changed in expression after both 6 and 30 months of treatment with fluticasone +/- salmeterol versus placebo. Next, an additional number of 59 samples from the fouth GLUCOLD treatment were put on array. In this study arm, COPD patients were treated for 6 months with fluticasone and then fluticasone was discontinued and patients switched to placebo for the remaining 24 months of the study.",,221,GPL6244,0

To investigate global and temporal responses of eutopic endometrium to P4, we compared early (6-h), intermediate (48-h), and late (14-day) transcriptomes, signaling pathways, and networks of human endometrial stromal fibroblasts (hESFs) from women with endometriosis (hESFendo) to hESFs from women without endometriosis (hESFnonendo). Endometrial biopsy samples were obtained from subjects with and without mild peritoneal endometriosis (n = 4 per group), and hESFs were isolated and treated with P4 (1 μM) plus estradiol (E2) (10 nM), E2 alone (10 nM), or vehicle for up to 14 days. Total RNA was subjected to microarray analysis using a Gene 1.0 ST (Affymetrix) platform and analyzed by using bioinformatic algorithms, and data were validated by quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA. Results revealed unique kinetic expression of specific genes and unique pathways, distinct biological and molecular processes, and signaling pathways and networks during the early, intermediate, and late responses to P4 in both hESFnonendo and hESFendo, although a blunted response to P4 was observed in the latter. The normal response of hESF to P4 involves a tightly regulated kinetic cascade involving key components in the P4 receptor and MAPK signaling pathways that results in inhibition of E2-mediated proliferation and eventual differentiation to the decidual phenotype, but this was not established in the hESFendo early response to P4. The abnormal response of this cell type to P4 may contribute to compromised embryonic implantation and infertility in women with endometriosis.","We compared early (6-h), intermediate (48-h), and late (14-day) in vitro whole-genome responses of hESF from women with endometriosis (hESFendo) to hESF from women without endometriosis (hESFnonendo) treated with P4 plus E2 (E2P4), E2 alone, or vehicle alone. Using this experimental paradigm, the data demonstrate unique phenotypes, gene expression processes, biochemical and signaling pathways, and networks suggestive of early, intermediate, and late responses of hESFnonendo and hESFendo to P4, giving insights into the complexity of events occurring normally in response to P4 and in the setting of endometriosis.",,80,GPL6244,0

GSE8970,A two-gene classifier for predicting response to the farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib in acute myeloid leukemia,"Currently there is no method available to predict response to farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTI). We analyzed gene expression profiles from the bone marrow of patients from a phase 2 study of the FTI tipifarnib, in older adults with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The RASGRP1:APTX gene expression ratio was found to predict response to tipifarnib with the greatest accuracy. This two-gene ratio was validated by quantitative PCR (QPCR) in the newly diagnosed AML cohort. We further demonstrated that this classifier could predict response to tipifarnib in an independent set of 54 samples from relapsed or refractory AML, with a negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) of 92% and 28%, respectively (odds ratio of 4.4). The classifier also predicted for improved overall survival (154 vs 56 days, p = 0.0001), which was shown to be independent of other prognostic factors including a previously described gene expression classifier predictive of overall survival. Therefore, these data indicate that a two-gene expression assay may have utility in categorizing a population of AML patients who are more likely to respond to tipifarnib.

GSE16716,MicroArray Quality Control Phase II (MAQC-II) Project,"The MAQC-II Project: A comprehensive study of common practices for the development and validation of microarray-based predictive models

The second phase of the MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC-II) project evaluated common practices for developing and validating microarray-based models aimed at predicting toxicological and clinical endpoints. The purposes of the MAQC-II project were to survey approaches in genomic model development  in an attempt to understand sources of variability in prediction performance, and to assess the  influences of endpoint signal strength in data. Thirty-six teams developed classifiers for 13 diverse  endpoints -- some easy, some difficult to predict, from six relatively large training data sets -- three  preclinical (toxicogenomics) and three clinical. By providing the same data sets to many organizations  for analysis, but not restricting their data analysis protocols (DAPs), the project made it possible  to evaluate to what extent, if any, results depend on the team that performs the analysis. These analyses  collectively produced >18,000 models that were challenged by independent and blinded validation sets  generated for MAQC-II. The cross-validated performance estimates for models developed under good  practices are predictive of the blinded validation performance. The achievable prediction performance  is largely determined by the intrinsic predictability of the endpoint, and simple data analysis methods  often perform as well as more complicated approaches. Multiple models of comparable performance can be developed for a given endpoint and the stability of gene lists correlates with endpoint predictability. Importantly, similar conclusions were reached when >12,000 new models were  generated by swapping the original training and validation sets.

Description of six data sets including 13 prediction endpoints:
(Summarized in GSE16716_MAQC-II_Datasets_Overview.pdf attached as supplementary file. For more details, see the MAQC-II main paper and its references for individual dataset.)

The MAQC-II predictive modeling was limited to binary classification problems; therefore, continuous endpoint values such as overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) times were dichotomized using a ""milestone"" cutoff of censor data. Prediction endpoints were chosen to span a wide range of prediction difficulty. Two endpoints, H (CPS1) and L (NEP_S), representing the gender of the patients, were used as positive control endpoints, since they are easily predictable by microarrays. Two other endpoints, I (CPS1) and M (NEP_R), representing randomly assigned class labels, were designed to serve as negative control endpoints, since they are not supposed to be predictable. Data analysis teams were not aware of the characteristics of endpoints H, I, L, and M until their swap prediction results had been submitted. If a data analysis protocol did not yield models to accurately predict endpoints H and L, or if a data analysis protocol claims to be able to yield models to accurately predict endpoints I and M, something must have gone wrong.

The Hamner data set (endpoint A) was provided by The Hamner Institutes for Health Sciences (Research Triangle Park, NC, USA). The study objective was to apply microarray gene expression data from the lung of female B6C3F1 mice exposed to a 13-week treatment of chemicals to predict increased lung tumor incidence in the 2-year rodent cancer bioassays of the National Toxicology Program. If successful, the results may form the basis of a more efficient and economical approach for evaluating the carcinogenic activity of chemicals. Microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays on three to four mice per treatment group, and a total of 70 mice were analyzed and used as the MAQC-II's training set. Additional data from another set of 88 mice were collected later and provided as the MAQC-II's external validation set.

The Iconix data set (endpoint B) was provided by Iconix Biosciences, Inc. (Mountain View, CA, USA). The study objective was to assess, upon short term exposure, hepatic tumor induction by non-genotoxic chemicals, since there are currently no accurate and well-validated short-term tests to identify non-genotoxic hepatic tumorigens, thus necessitating an expensive 2-year rodent bioassay before a risk assessment can begin. The training set consists of hepatic gene expression data from 216 male Sprague-Dawley rats treated for 5 days with one of 76 structurally and mechanistically diverse nongenotoxic hepatocarcinogens and non-hepatocarcinogens. The validation set consists of 201 male Sprague-Dawley rats treated for 5 days with one of 68 structurally and mechanistically diverse non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogens and non- hepatocarcinogens. Gene expression data were generated using the Amersham Codelink Uniset Rat 1 Bioarray (GE HealthCare, Piscataway, NJ). The separation of the training set and validation set was based on the time when the microarray data were collected; i.e., microarrays processed earlier in the study were used as training and those processed later were used as validation.

The NIEHS data set (endpoint C) was provided by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) of the National Institutes of Health (Research Triangle Park, NC, USA). The study objective was to use microarray gene expression data acquired from the liver of rats exposed to hepatotoxicants to build classifiers for prediction of liver necrosis. The gene expression ""compendium"" data set was collected from 418 rats exposed to one of eight compounds (1,2- dichlorobenzene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, bromobenzene, monocrotaline, N-nitrosomorpholine, thioacetamide, galactosamine, and diquat dibromide). All eight compounds were studied using standardized procedures, i.e. a common array platform (Affymetrix Rat 230 2.0 microarray), experimental procedures and data retrieving and analysis processes. Briefly, for each compound,  four to six male, 12 week old F344 rats were exposed to a low dose, mid dose(s) and a high dose  of the toxicant and sacrificed at 6, 24 and 48 hrs later. At necropsy, liver was harvested for  RNA extraction, histopathology, and clinical chemistry assessments.

The human breast cancer (BR) data set (endpoints D and E) was contributed by the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC, Houston, TX, USA). Gene expression data from 230 stage I-III breast cancers were generated from fine needle aspiration specimens of newly diagnosed breast cancers before any therapy. The biopsy specimens were collected sequentially during a prospective pharmacogenomic marker discovery study between 2000 and 2008. These specimens represent 70-90% pure neoplastic cells with minimal stromal contamination. Patients received 6 months of preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy including paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin followed by surgical resection of the cancer. Response to preoperative chemotherapy was categorized as a pathological complete response (pCR = no residual invasive cancer in the breast or lymph nodes) or residual invasive cancer (RD), and used as endpoint D for prediction. Endpoint E is the clinical estrogen-receptor status as established by immunohistochemistry. RNA extraction and gene expression profiling were performed in multiple batches over time using Affymetrix U133A microarrays. Genomic analysis of a subset of this sequentially accrued patient population were reported previously. For each endpoint, the first 130 cases were used as a training set and the next 100 cases were used as an independent validation set.

The multiple myeloma (MM) data set (endpoints F, G, H, and I) was contributed by the Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS, Little Rock, AR, USA). Gene expression profiling of highly purified bone marrow plasma cells was performed in newly diagnosed patients with MM. The training set consisted of 340 cases enrolled on total therapy 2 (TT2) and the validation set comprised 214 patients enrolled in total therapy 3 (TT3). Plasma cells were enriched by anti-CD138 immunomagnetic bead selection of mononuclear cell fractions of bone marrow aspirates in a central laboratory. All samples applied to the microarray contained more than 85% plasma cells as determined by 2-color flow cytometry  (CD38+ and CD45-/dim) performed after selection. Dichotomized overall survival (OS) and eventfree survival (EFS) were determined based on a two-year milestone cutoff. A gene expression model of  high-risk multiple myeloma was developed and validated by the data provider and later on validated in three additional independent data sets.

The neuroblastoma (NB) data set (endpoints J, K, L, and M) was contributed by the Children's Hospital of the University of Cologne, Germany. Tumor samples were checked by a pathologist prior  to RNA isolation; only samples with =60% tumor content were utilized and total RNA was isolated  from ~50mg of snap-frozen neuroblastoma tissue obtained before chemotherapeutic treatment. First, 502 pre-existing 11K Agilent dye-flipped, dual-color replicate profiles for 251 patients were provided. Of these, profiles of 246 neuroblastoma samples passed an independent MAQC-II quality assessment by majority decision and formed the MAQC-II training data set. Subsequently, 514 dyeflipped dual-color 11K replicate profiles for 256 independent neuroblastoma tumor samples were generated and profiles for 253 samples were selected to form the MAQC-II validation set. Of note, for one patient of the validation set, two different tumor samples were analyzed utilizing both versions of the 2x11K microarray (see below). All dual-color gene-expression of the MAQC-II training set were generated using a customized 2x11K neuroblastoma-related microarray. Furthermore, 20 patients of the MAQC-II validation set were also profiled utilizing this microarray. Dual-color profiles of the remaining patients of the MAQC-II validation set were performed using a slightly revised version of the 2x11K microarray. This version V2.0 of the array comprised 200 novel oligonucleotide probes whereas 100 oligonucleotide probes of the original design were removed due to consistent low expression values (near background) observed in the training set profiles. These minor modifications of the microarray design resulted in a total of 9,986 probes present on both versions of the 2x11K microarray. The experimental protocol did not differ between both sets and gene-expression profiles were performed as described. Furthermore, single-color geneexpression profiles were generated for 478/499 neuroblastoma samples of the MAQC-II dual-color training and validation sets (training set 244/246; validation set 234/253). For the remaining 21 samples no single-color data were available, due to either shortage of tumor material of these patients (n=15), poor experimental quality of the generated single-color profiles (n=5), or correlation of one single-color profile to two different dual-color profiles for the one patient profiled with both versions of the 2x11K microarrays (n=1). Single-color gene-expression profiles were generated using customized 4x44K oligonucleotide microarrays produced by Agilent Technologies (Palo Alto, CA, USA). These 4x44K microarrays included all probes represented by Agilent's Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray and all probes of the version V2.0 of the 2x11K customized microarray that were not present in the former probe set. Labeling and hybridization was performed following the manufacturer's protocol as described.

GSE50614,"A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate SRT2104, a Selective SIRT1 Activator, in Patients with Moderate to Severe Psoriasis","Activation of Sirtuin (silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog) 1, or SIRT1, is an unexplored therapeutic approach for treatment of inflammatory diseases. The goal of this study was to evaluate the clinical activity and tolerability of multiple doses of SRT2104, a selective activator of SIRT1, in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis after day 84 of treatment. Forty patients were randomized 4:1 to three escalating doses of SRT2104 (250, 500, 1000 mg/d SRT2104 or placebo). Across all SRT2104 groups, 34.6% of patients (9 out of 26; 90% CI 18.0%-54.2%, p<0.0001) achieved good to excellent histological improvement based on skin biopsies taken at baseline and day 84.  To evaluate the changes in expression profile with treatment and to identify pathways involved in histological improvement, a subset of 22 Pre and Post treatment biopsies from 11 patients (4 Placebo, 7 Active Treatment) were hybridized to hgu133plus2 chips. Improvement in histology was associated with modulation of IL-17 and TNF-_ signaling pathways and keratinocyte differentiation target genes. Various studies suggest a crucial role of TNF_ and IL-17 in psoriasis pathogenesis and IL-17/TNF_ synergism induces a strong induction of differentially expressed genes in psoriasis, thus advocating a crucial role of IL-17/TNF_ combination in the molecular basis of disease (Chiricozzi et al., 2010).  In the current study, broad scale gene expression profiling revealed that SRT2104 significantly reduced known IL-17 and TNF_ responsive genes including SERPINB4, S100A12, SERPINB3, kynu etc. even though the sample size for this analysis was small. One of the most highly modulated genes by SRT2104 included Kynu, a gene that regulates tryptophan metabolism, known to confer antibacterial effector functions (Daubener and MacKenzie, 1999). Interestingly kynu is part of the etanercept residual genomic profile that is not modulated by etanercept therapy even though clinical efficacy is achieved. Possibly, SRT2104 may be modulating the lipid barrier of the epidermis of psoriatic skin via modulation of keratinocyte diferentiation genes, which would be consistent with the observed improvement in skin histology. These results indicate a combinatorial effect of SRT2104 on TNF_, and IL-17 inflammatory signaling pathways and keratinocyte differentiation that could be a contributing factor towards improvement in clinical scores by the SIRT1 activator, SRT2104.","Paired  Pre (Day 1) and Post (Day 84) Treatment samples were obtained from 4 Placebo Patients and 7 patients treated with SRT2104 at 3 different doses (250, 500, 1000 mg).",,22,GPL570,0

Ibrutinib is an oral covalent BTK inhibitor that has shown some efficacy in both indications. To improve ibrutinib efficacy through combination therapy, we first investigated differential gene expression in parental and ibrutinib-resistant cell lines to better understand the mechanisms of resistance. Ibrutinib-resistant TMD8 cells had higher BCL2 gene expression and increased sensitivity to ABT-199, a BCL-2 inhibitor. Consistently, clinical samples from ABC-DLBCL patients who experienced poorer response to ibrutinib had higher BCL2 gene expression. We further demonstrated synergistic growth suppression by ibrutinib and ABT-199 in multiple ABC-DLBCL, GCB-DLBCL, and FL lymphoma cell lines. The combination of both drugs also reduced colony formation, increased apoptosis, and inhibited tumor growth in a TMD8 xenograft model. A synergistic combination effect was also found in ibrutinib-resistant cells generated by either genetic mutation or drug treatment. Together, these findings suggest a potential clinical benefit from ibrutinib and ABT-199 combination therapy.","Gene expression in ibrutinib pretreated tumor biopsy samples from ABC-DLBCL patients was detected by U133 plus 2.0 arrays and the correlation of BCL2 expression and patient response to ibrutinib or PFS after ibrutinib treatment was analyzed.

GSE46819,Inhibitor of apoptosis protein antagonist BV6 – potential for new combinatorial treatment strategies in acute myeloid leukemia,"Apoptosis is deregulated in most, if not all, cancers, including hematological malignancies. In this study, we wanted to test whether primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples are sensitive for inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) protein antagonist treatment in vitro, and which AML subgroup might profit most from such a novel therapeutic strategy. We treated diagnostic samples of 67 adult AML patients with either cytarabine (ara-C) or IAP antagonist BV6 and correlated sensitivity with clinical, cytogenetic and molecular markers, and expression levels of selected genes involved in apoptosis. Primary AML samples showed differential sensitivity to treatment with either ara-C (40% sensitive, 17% intermediate, 43% resistant) or BV6 (51% sensitive, 21% intermediate, 28% resistant). Notably, 69% of ara-C resistant samples showed a good to fair response to IAP inhibition. Furthermore, combination treatment of ara-C with BV6 showed additive effects in most samples. Differences in sensitivity to IAP antagonist treatment correlated with significantly elevated expression levels of TNF and lower levels of XIAP in BV6 sensitive samples, as well as with NPM1 mutations. Gene expression profiling pointed to apoptosis-related pathways, which were specifically induced by IAP inhibition in sensitive samples. Thus, our results suggest IAP inhibition as a potential novel therapeutic option in AML.","Gene expression was profiled in 24 AML samples [n=12 untreated, diagnostic samples of BV6 resistant (n=6) and sensitive (n=6) cases; n=6 paired samples (BV6 sensitive n=3 and resistant n=3 cases) treated for 24 hours with either DMSO or BV6].",,24,GPL570,0

In this study, we used microarrays to examine gene expression from the muscle of two cohorts of infantile-onset Pompe patients to identify transcriptional differences that may contribute to the disease phenotype. We found strong similarities among the gene expression profiles generated from biceps and quadriceps, and identified a number of signaling pathways altered in both cohorts. We also found that infantile-onset Pompe patient muscle had a gene expression pattern characteristic of immature or regenerating muscle, and exhibited many transcriptional markers of inflammation, despite having few overt signs of inflammatory infiltrate. Further, we identified genes exhibiting correlation between expression at baseline and response to therapy.

The three alleles and mutants, with the exception of mutants TatSF21-47 and TatSF2G48-R57A that do not localize in the nucleous, modulated to different degrees IFN-inducible genes without concomitant induction of IFN’s. The first exon TatSF21-72 and the minimal transactivator TatSF21-58, all induced genes to a significantly greater extent than full-length Tat. The 2nd exon appears to diminish the gene modulation that can be observed when the first exon alone is expressed.
We investigated the effect of various Tat alleles and mutants on host cell gene expression in immature dendritic cells (iDC). The cells were infected with adenoviruses expressing the Tat constructs.","The Tat alleles and mutants are under a tetracycline inducible promoter and are expressed only in cells co-infected with Ad-tTA, which expresses the tetracycline responsive transactivator. 10e6 iDC were infected with 5 plague forming units per cell of the adenoviruses and cells were collected  10 and 20 hours post-infection.

All patients were naïve to anti_TNFs. The disease activity was measured using the DAS28 score at the pre-treatment visit1 (DAS28_v1)  and 14 weeks after treatment visit3 (DAS28_v3). The response to the therapy was evaluated using the EULAR [European League Against Rheumatism] definition of the response. The objective of the data analysis was to identify gene expression coorelating with response as well as to identify genes that differentiate responders versus non-responders pre-treatment.

Interestingly, three cases (43%) were MYC-translocation-negative and revealed the 11q-gain/loss aberration recently identified in 3% of mBL developed in immunocompetent hosts.1 Based on array CGH data, minimal gain and loss regions of 11q (MGR/~4Mb and MLR/~13.5Mb, respectively) were defined and integrative genomic and transcriptomic analysis identified 35 differentially expressed genes, when compared with classic BL. All 16 MGR-dysregulated genes were upregulated, including cancer related USP2, CBL and PAFAH1B2. As expected, all 19 MGL-dysregulated genes were downregulated and two of them, TBRG1 and EI24, are potential tumor suppressor genes. Interestingly, the vast majority of dysregulated 11q23-q25 genes are involved in the MYC and TP53 networks. We hypothesize that the 11q-gain/loss aberration represents a “molecular variant” of t(8q24/MYC) and affects the same pathological pathways as the MYC oncogene.","Seven cases of PTLD with BL features were selected from a cohort of 174 posttransplant patients diagnosed with PTLD between 1989 and 2012 at the University Hospitals of KU Leuven (Leuven, Belgium).

To this end, an oligonucleotide microarray was performed (Affymetrix’s HG-U133 Plus 2.0 array). This gene expression study was carried out on the biopsied tumor samples previous being treated with chemotherapy, and subsequently compared with themselves once treatment schedule ended. The post-chemotherapy biopsy was obtained from the surgical piece. The goal of this study was the finding of several genes related to apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, survival and transformation-related genes and correlating their differences in expression with the degree of response to chemotherapy, determined by the Miller and Payne histological grading system.","After informed consent, patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer and scheduled chemotherapy treatment based on Anthracyclines and Taxanes (Treatment A: Epirubicin 90 mg/m2-Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, 3 cycles bi-weekly and Taxol 150 mg/m2-Gemcitabine 2500 mg/m2, 6 cycles bi-weekly ± weekly Herceptin 4 mg/Kg during the first week, 2 mg/Kg for the remaining 11 cycles; Treatment B: Doxorubicin 60 mg/m2-Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2, 4 cycles tri-weekly and Taxotere 100 mg/m2, 4 cycles tri-weekly; Treatment C: Doxorubicin 60 mg/m2-Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, 4 cycles tri-weekly and Taxotere 100 mg/m2, 4 cycles tri-weekly) were recruited for this study. Pre-chemotherapy and post-chemotherapy biopsies were examined by a pathologist who determined the Miller & Payne grade for each patient. Matching pairs of pre-chemotherapy and post-chemotherapy samples were divided into 3 groups according to Miller & Payne grade: group of bad response (Miller & Payne grades 1 and 2), group of mid response (Miller & Payne grade 3) and group of good response (Miller & Payne grades 4 and 5). Gene expression analysis was performed in paired samples as follows: bad response group post-chemotherapy biopsy vs pre-chemotherapy biopsy (Bad Final vs Initial). For this assay were necessary 13 samples being chosen according to histopathologic criteria (Miller & Payne grades 4 and 5). Of them, 10 samples were paired and 3 pre-chemotherapy samples from patients that experienced a good response to chemotherapy were also included in this experimental series. Other comparisons in which this group of samples was involved include: Initial Bad vs Good, Initial Good vs Mid, Final Mid vs Good and Final Bad vs Good. This gene expression profiling was carried out making use of Affymetrix’s GeneChip technology, with the Affymetrix’s HG-U133 Plus 2.0 array from this provider.

GSE58093,"Low-dose, long-wave UV light does not affect gene expression of human mesenchymal stem cells","This experiment was conducted to test multiple hypotheses: 1) long-wave 365 nm UV light exposure at low fluences does not alter gene expression of hMSC, 2) presence of radical species during polymerization causes DNA damage in hMSC, 3) 3D encapsulation of hMSC causes changes in gene expression of hMSC compared with traditional 2D culture, 4) Differencesin 3D hydrogel networks induce gene expression changes in hMSC
The first publication derived from this data set concerns UV exposure and reactive radical species. Light is a non-invasive tool that is widely used in a range of biomedical applications.  Techniques such as photopolymerization, photodegradation and photouncaging can be used to alter the chemical and physical properties of biomaterials in the presence of live cells. Long-wave UV light is an easily accessible and commonly used wavelength.  Although exposure to low doses of long-wave UV light is generally accepted as biocompatible, most studies only investigate cell viability, ignoring other possible non-toxic effects. Since light exposure could potentially induce phenotypic changes (i.e. if damage repair mechanisms are activated), we examined changes in gene expression of human mesenchymal stem cells exposed to light under various 2D and 3D culture conditions. While exposure to long-wave UV light did not induce any significant changes in gene expression regardless of culture conditions, significant changes were observed due to scaffold fabrication chemistry and between cells plated in 2D versus 3D scaffolds.","In total, 24 samples were analyzed. Three different culture conditions were created: 2D(plated), 3DR (encapsulated, radical polymerization), and 3DC (encapsulated, conjugate addition).

GSE15913,Thalidomide Exerts Distinct Molecular Antileukemic Effects,"Thalidomide Exerts Distinct Molecular Antileukemic Effects and Combined Thalidomide/Fludarabine Therapy is Clinically Effective in High-Risk Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia

Background: Thalidomide represents a promising immunomodulatory drug that targets both leukemia cells and the tumor microenvironment.
Methods: We treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients with a combined thalidomide/fludarabine regimen and monitored cellular and molecular changes induced by thalidomide in-vivo prior to fludarabine treatment. Thalidomide was given daily (100mg p.o./day) and fludarabine was administered on days 7-11 (25 mg/m² i.v./day) within each 4-week cycle (maximum of 6 cycles). Twenty patients received thalidomide/fludarabine as first line therapy and 20 patients were previously treated. Unmutated IgVH mutation status was found in 36 cases and 13 had high-risk cytogenetic aberrations (deletion of 17p13 or 11q22-q23).
Results: The overall response rate was 80% and 25% for untreated and previously treated patients, respectively. While thalidomide effectively reduced the number of CLL cells, the number of CD3 lymphocytes showed no significant change, but the number of CD4+CD25hiFOXP3+ T-regulatory cells was significantly decreased. Gene expression profiling revealed a thalidomide induced signature containing both targets known to play a role in immunomodulatory drug action as well as novel candidate genes.
Conclusions: Combined thalidomide/fludarabine therapy demonstrated efficacy in high-risk CLL patients. Furthermore, our study provides novel biological insights into thalidomide effect, which might act by enhancing apoptosis of CLL cells and reducing Tregs, thereby enabling T-cell dependent anti-tumor effect.","Patients (""preTHAL"") received thalidomide (100mg p.o./day) starting at day 0 and at day 7 Fludarabine therapy was added to the therapy. To evaluate the in-vivo influence of thalidomide on the transcriptome in CLL, paired GEP was performed in 20 cases at treatment start at day 0 (preTHAL) and prior to fludarabine treatment at day 7 (postTHAL) using HumanGenome U133 Plus2.0 Arrays according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Affymetrix; RNA was isolated from peripheral blood samples enriched for leukemic cells by Ficoll-density gradient centrifugation, percentage of leukemic cells > 90%).

GSE40837,A phase II study of adding the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib to endocrine therapy in patients with metastatic ER-positive breast cancer.,"Growth factor signaling and angiogenesis may promote endocrine-resistance in breast cancer and blocking these pathways can overcome resistance in preclinical models.  We conducted a phase-II study of adding the VEGFR/Ras/Raf/MAPK inhibitor sorafenib to endocrine therapy in metastatic ER-positive breast cancer, either upon progression or after maximal response with measurable residual disease. Tumor biopsies and serum were collected on days 1 and 28. Primary endpoint was response by RECIST after 3 months and secondary endpoints included safety, time to progression (TTP), and biomarker assessment. Planned sample size was 43 patients but the study closed after 11 patients because of slow accrual. 8 patients had progressive disease (PD) on entry and 3 had stable disease (SD). One patient with SD discontinued sorafenib after 2-weeks because of grade 3 rash. Of the 10 remaining patients after adding sorafenib, 7 had SD (70%), 3 had PD (30%) and median TTP was 6.1-months. Of the 8 patients who entered the study with PD on endocrine therapy, 5 converted to SD (62%) with a median TTP of 6.4-months. Notably, patients on tamoxifen had a median TTP of 8.4-months. The most common adverse events were hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, and rash, and the majority were grade 1&2 with no grade 4 toxicities. There was a significant reduction in serum VEGFR2 and PDGFR-α on day-28 (p-values 0.0035 and 0.017, respectively). Both serum VEGF and sVEGFR-1 were increased on day-28, but the differences were not statistically significant (p-values 0.3223 and 0.084, respectively). Microarray analysis identified 32 suppressed genes with an FDR of <0.20 and at least a 2-fold change with no induced genes and 29 KEGG pathways were enriched on day-28.  Our study suggests that sorafenib can restore endocrine sensitivity, particularly tamoxifen, and this strategy of adding novel agents in patients progressing on endocrine therapy should be examined in future trials.","This was a single-institution, phase II study of adding sorafenib to existing endocrine therapy.  On study entry, eligible patients underwent serum sample collection and core biopsy of accessible disease (if applicable) on endocrine therapy and prior to starting sorafenib.  Serum and a second biopsy were then collected on day 28. Sorafenib dose was 400mg orally twice daily along with continuing the same endocrine agent.

GSE24742,Effects of Rituximab on global gene expression profiles in the RA synovium,"Objective: Rituximab displays therapeutic benefits in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients resistant to TNF blockade. However, the precise role of B cells in the pathogenesis of RA is still unknown. In this study we investigated the global molecular effects of rituximab in synovial biopsies obtained from anti-TNF resistant RA patients before and after administration of the drug.

Methods: Paired synovial biopsies were obtained from the affected knee of anti-TNF resistant RA patients before (T0) and 12 weeks after initiation of rituximab therapy (T12). Total RNA was extracted, labeled according to standard Affymetrix procedures and hybridized on GeneChip HGU133 Plus 2.0 slides. Immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR experiments were performed to confirm the differential expression of selected transcripts.

Results: According to paired Student’s t-tests, 549 out of 54,675 investigated probe sets were differentially expressed between T0 and T12. Pathway analysis revealed that genes down-regulated between T0 and T12 were significantly enriched in immunoglobulin genes, and genes involved in chemotaxis, leucocyte activation and immune responses (Gene Ontology annotations). By contrast, genes up-regulated between T0 and T12 were significantly enriched in transcripts involved in cell development (Gene Ontology annotation) and wound healing (GSEA). At baseline, higher synovial expression of immunoglobulin genes was associated with response to therapy.

Conclusion: Rituximab displays unique effects on global gene expression profiles in synovial tissue of RA patients. These observations open new perspectives in the understanding of the biological effects of the drug and in the selection of patients likely to benefit from this therapy.","Twenty patients with RA (17 women and 3 men, average age +/- SEM: 52,6+/-3,8 years) were included in the study. All patients met the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for the diagnosis of RA. All patients had active disease at the time of tissue sampling and were resistant to TNF blockade. They all had erosive changes imaged on conventional x-rays of the hands and/or feet. All of them had a swollen knee at inclusion. Rituximab therapy was administrated at a dose of 1,000 mg IV at baseline (T0) and at week 2, together with 125 mg IV Methylprednisolone. Clinical parameters at baseline (T0) and 12 weeks after the initiation of therapy (T12) was evaluated using DAS(28)-CRP scores and clinical responses were assessed using EULAR response criteria. Synovial biopsies were obtained by needle-arthroscopy of an affected knee from all patients at T0 and T12. For each procedure, 4 to 8 synovial samples were kept overnight at 4°C in a RNA stabilizing solution (RNALater, Ambion, Applied Biosystems, TX, USA) and then stored at –80°C for later RNA extraction. The same amount of tissue was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at –80°C for immunostaining experiments on frozen sections. The remaining material was fixed in 10% formaldehyde and paraffin embedded for conventional optical evaluation and immunostaining of selected markers. All the experiments (RNA extraction, histology, immunohistochemistry) were performed on at least 4 biopsies harvested during every procedure in order to correct for variations related to the potential heterogeneous distribution of synovial inflammation.

To address the molecular mechanism of the anti-leukemic GC effects, we performed microarray-based whole-genome expression profiling of lymphoblasts from 46 patients undergoing systemic GC mono-therapy and combined these data with clinical information (e.g., molecular genotype, reduction in peripheral blood lymphoblasts, GC bioactivity in the patient's blood) using differential gene expression with GO analyses, regression modeling correlating transcriptional with clinical response, and an iterative elastic net approach to address combinatorial effects of gene expression and regulation. Our analysis revealed that, although there are a number of common response genes, the transcriptional response to GC in vivo varies considerably in the different molecular subtypes of this disease. Regarding the anti-leukemic response, repression of mRNA for key regulators of G2/M transition was commonly observed in all subtypes whereas we failed to observe a common transcriptional control of apoptosis genes. Although sets of genes were identified which in combination appear to contribute to the apoptotic response, the data as a whole suggest that GC-induced cell death does not result from conserved transcriptional regulation of the apoptotic machinery itself but might rather result from a wide spread deregulation of gene expression.","For differential expression analysis, M-values (log2 fold change values) were calculated for each patient comparing the 6 or 24 hour gene expression profile to the gene expression profile prior to treatment start (0h time point). Differential expression analysis was performed on these M-values using the moderated t-test from limma employing two different linear models, one including a factor for the time point, thus identifying differentially expressed genes after 6 or 24 hours of GC treatment (common GC response), and one with an additional factor for the chALL subtype, thus identifying differentially expressed genes after 6 or 24 hours in each subtype (sub-type specific response).

GSE56017,Mertk negatively regulates adaptive immunity,"Tolerogenic dendritic cells (tol-DCs) offer a promising therapeutic potential for autoimmune diseases. Tol-DCs have been reported to inhibit immunogenic responses, yet little is known about the mechanisms controlling their tolerogenic status, as well as associated specific markers. Here we show that the anti-inflammatory TAM receptor tyrosine kinase MERTK, is highly expressed on clinical grade dexamethasone-induced human tol-DCs and mediates their tolerogenic effect. Neutralization of MERTK in allogenic mixed lymphocyte reactions as well as autologous DC-T cell cultures leads to increased T cell proliferation and IFN-g production. Additionally, we identify a previously unrecognized non-cell autonomous regulatory function of MERTK expressed on DCs. Recombinant Mer-Fc protein, used to mimic MERTK on DCs, suppresses naïve and antigen-specific memory T cell activation. This mechanism is mediated by the neutralization of the MERTK agonist Protein S (PROS1) expressed by T cells. We find that MERTK and PROS1 are expressed in human T cells upon TCR activation and drive an autocrine pro-proliferative mechanism. Collectively, these results suggest that MERTK on tol-DCs directly inhibits T cell activation through the competition for PROS1 interaction with MERTK in the T cells. Targeting MERTK may provide an interesting approach to effectively increase or suppress tolerance for the purpose of immunotherapy.","The complete database comprised the expression measurements of 54,675 genes for: immature (n=9), mature (n=7) and tolerogenic (n=8).

Gene expression profiles from infliximab responders were compared with those of baseline and infliximab non-responder samples.
Infliximab had a significant effect on mRNA expression in treatment responders, with both infliximab dose and duration of treatment having an effect.  Genes affected are primarily involved with inflammatory response, cell-mediated immune responses, and cell-to-cell signaling.

To overcome these limitations, we propagated a cohort of human breast tumors grown in the epithelium-free mammary fat pad of SCID/Beige and NOD/SCID/IL2γ-receptor null (NSG) mice, under a series of transplant conditions.  Both models yielded stably transplantable xenografts at comparably high rates (~23% and ~19%, respectively). Of the conditions tested, xenograft take rate was highest in the presence of a low-dose estradiol pellet. Overall, 32 stably transplantable xenograft lines were established, representing unique 25 patients. Most tumors yielding xenografts were “triple-negative” (ER-PR-HER2+) (n=19). However, we established lines from three ER-PR-HER2+ tumors, one ER+PR-HER2-, one ER+PR+HER2- and one “triple-positive” (ER+PR+HER2+) tumor. Serially passaged xenografts show biological consistency with the tumor of origin, are phenotypic stability across multiple transplant generations at the histological, transcriptomic, proteomic, and genomic levels, and show comparable treatment responses. Xenografts representing 12 patients, including two ER+ lines, showed metastasis to the mouse lung. These models thus serve as a renewable, quality-controlled tissue resource for preclinical studies investigating treatment response and metastasis.","The study was designed to determine how stable patient-derived xenografts are across multiple transplant generations in mice, and to determine how closely xenografts established with pre-treatment samples cluster with xenografts established with post-treatment samples.

GSE73066,Transcriptional profiles of pilocytic astrocytoma,"Pilocytic astrocytoma is the most common type of brain tumor in pediatric population, generally connected with favorable prognosis, although recurrences or dissemination sometimes are also observed. For tumors originating in supra- or infratentorial location different molecular background was suggested but plausible correlations between transcriptional profile and radiological features and/or clinical course are still undefined. The purpose of this study was to identify gene expression profiles related to the most frequent locations of this tumor, subtypes based on various radiological features and clinical pattern of the disease.   According to the radiological features presented on MRI, all cases were divided into four subtypes: solid or mainly solid, cystic with an enhancing cyst wall, cystic with a non-enhancing cyst wall and solid with central necrosis. Bioinformatic analyses showed that gene expression profile of pilocytic astrocytoma highly depends on the tumor location. Most prominent differences were noted for IRX2, PAX3, CXCL14, LHX2, SIX6, CNTN1 and SIX1 genes expression which could distinguish pilocytic astrocytomas of different location even within supratentorial region. Analysis of the genes potentially associated between radiological features showed much weaker transcriptome differences. Single genes showed association with the tendency to progression.   Here we showed that pilocytic astrocytomas of three different locations could be precisely differentiated on the basis of gene expression level but their transcriptional profiles did not strongly reflect the radiological appearance of the tumor or the course of the disease.","Gene expression profiling was performed in 47 pilocytic astrocytoma tumours characterized by different localization, radiology and progression.",,47,GPL570,0

GSE42762,FOXO3a Is A Major Target Of Inactivation By PI3K/AKT Signaling In Aggressive Neuroblastoma,"Neuroblastoma is a pediatric tumor of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system with a highly variable prognosis. Activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in neuroblastoma is correlated with poor patient prognosis, but the precise downstream effectors mediating this effect have not been determined. Here, we identify the forkhead transcription factor FOXO3a as a key target of the PI3K/AKT pathway in neuroblastoma. FOXO3a expression was elevated in low stage neuroblastoma tumors and normal embryonal neuroblasts, but reduced in late stage neuroblastoma. Inactivation of FOXO3a by AKT was essential for neuroblastoma cell survival. Treatment of neuroblastoma cells with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PI-103 activated FOXO3a and triggered apoptosis. This effect was rescued by FOXO3a silencing. Conversely, apoptosis induced by PI-103 or the AKT inhibitor MK-2206 was potentiated by FOXO3a overexpression. Further, levels of total or phosphorylated FOXO3a correlated closely with apoptotic sensitivity to MK-2206. In clinical specimens, there was an inverse relationship between gene expression signatures regulated by PI3K signaling and FOXO3a transcriptional activity. Moreover, high PI3K activity and low FOXO3a activity were each associated with an extremely poor prognosis. Our work indicates that expression of FOXO3a and its targets offer useful prognostic markers as well as biomarkers for PI3K/AKT inhibitor efficacy in neuroblastoma.",Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 profiling of SY5Y-TetR-FOXO3A cells treated with doxycycline and/or the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PI-103.

Glucocorticoids (GCs) cause apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in lymphoid cells and constitute a central component in the therapy of lymphoid malignancies, most notably childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PFKFB2 (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase-2), a kinase controlling glucose metabolism, was identified by us previously as GC response gene in expression profiling analyses performed in children with ALL during initial systemic GC mono-therapy. Since deregulation of glucose metabolism has been implicated in apoptosis induction, this gene and its relatives PFKFB1, 3, and 4 were further analyzed. Expression analyses in additional ALL children, non-leukemic individuals and leukemic cell lines confirmed frequent PFKFB2 induction by GC in most systems sensitive to GC-induced apoptosis, particularly in T-ALL cells. The 3 other family members, in contrast, were not or weakly expressed (PFKFB1 and 4) or not induced by GC (PFKFB3). Conditional PFKFB2 over-expression in the CCRF-CEM T-ALL in vitro model revealed that its 2 splice variants (15A and 15B) did not have any detectable effect on survival or cell cycle progression. Moreover, neither PFKFB2 splice variant significantly affected sensitivity to, or kinetics of, GC-induced apoptosis. Our data suggest that, at least in the model system investigated, PFKFB2 is not an essential upstream regulator of the anti-leukemic effects of GC.
Generation of the GC sensitive and resistant clones is described in Parson et al. FASEB J 2005 (Pubmed id 15637111). In brief GC sensitive clones were generated by limiting dilution subcloning from the GC sensitive T-ALL cell line CCRF-CEM-C7H2.

GSE37699,Aberrant ERK signaling causes resistance to EGFR kinase inhibitors,"The clinical efficacy of EGFR kinase inhibitors is limited by the development of drug resistance. The irreversible EGFR kinase inhibitor WZ4002 is effective against the most common mechanism of drug resistance mediated by the EGFR T790M mutation. Here we show that in multiple complementary models harboring EGFR T790M, resistance to WZ4002 develops through aberrant activation of ERK signaling caused by either an amplification of MAPK1 or by downregulation of negative regulators of ERK signaling. Inhibition of MEK or ERK restores sensitivity to WZ4002, and the combination of WZ4002 and a MEK inhibitor prevents the emergence of drug resistance. The WZ4002 resistant MAPK1 amplified cells also demonstrate an increase both in EGFR internalization and a decrease in sensitivity to cytotoxic chemotherapy compared to the parental counterparts. Our findings provide insights into mechanisms of drug resistance to EGFR kinase inhibitors and highlight rational combination therapies that should be evaluated in clinical trials.

Our study identifies ERK signaling as a mediator of resistance to irreversible pyrimidine EGFR inhibitors in EGFR T790M-bearing cancers. We further provide a therapeutic strategy to both treat and prevent the emergence of this resistance mechanism.","To generate drug-resistant NCI-H1975 cell lines, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of WZ4002 similar to previously described methods.

Methods: The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Secondary objectives included toxicity, response rate (RR), pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Based on the 3+3 design, cohorts of 3-6 pts received paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 6 every three weeks with escalating doses of dasatinib (100, 120, 150 mg daily), followed by an 8 patient expansion cohort. Results: Twenty patients were enrolled between 06/07 and 12/09. The median age was 61 yrs (42-82) with a median of 2 prior regimens (0-6), and 71% had platinum-sensitive disease. There were 3-6 pts in each cohort, and 8 in the expansion cohort. Pharmacokinetics were observed over the first 2 cycles of therapy.

GSE36223,Molecular defense mechanisms of Barrett's metaplasia estimated by an integrative genomics,"Barrett's esophagus is characterized by the replacement of squamous epithelium with specialized intestinal metaplastic mucosa. The exact mechanisms of initiation and development of Barrett's metaplasia remain unknown, but a hypothesis of successful adaptation against noxious reflux components has been proposed. To search for the repertoire of adaptation mechanisms of Barrett's metaplasia, we employed high-throughput functional genomic and proteomic methods that defined the molecular background of metaplastic mucosa resistance to reflux. Transcriptional profiling was established for 23 pairs of esophageal squamous epithelium and Barrett's metaplasia tissue samples using Affymetrix U133A 2.0 GeneChips and validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Differences in protein composition were assessed by electrophoretic and mass-spectrometry-based methods. Among 2,822 genes differentially expressed between Barrett's metaplasia and squamous epithelium, we observed significantly overexpressed metaplastic mucosa genes that encode cytokines and growth factors, constituents of extracellular matrix, basement membrane and tight junctions, and proteins involved in prostaglandin and phosphoinositol metabolism, nitric oxide production, and bioenergetics. Their expression likely reflects defense and repair responses of metaplastic mucosa, whereas overexpression of genes encoding heat shock proteins and several protein kinases in squamous epithelium may reflect lower resistance of normal esophageal epithelium than Barrett's metaplasia to reflux components. Despite the methodological and interpretative difficulties in data analyses discussed in this paper, our studies confirm that Barrett's metaplasia may be regarded as a specific microevolution allowing for accumulation of mucosal morphological and physiological changes that better protect against reflux injury.

Cancer cells treated with COX-2 inhibitors, such as the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, show growth inhibition and the induction of apoptosis, through alterations in inflammatory processes, angiogenesis, cell adhesion and transforming growth factor-β signaling.  This study was conducted to determine if the same processes are relevant to celecoxib’s effects on human colorectal adenocarcinomas treated in vivo.  A cohort of 23 patients with primary colorectal adenocarcinomas was randomized to receive a 7-day course of celecoxib (400 mg b.i.d.) or no drug prior to surgical resection.  Gene expression profiling was performed on resected adenocarcinomas from patients with and without celecoxib pre-treatment.  Using fold change (>1.5) and p-value (<0.05) cut-offs, 190 genes were differentially expressed between adenocarcinomas from patients receiving celecoxib and those that did not.  Of the differentially expressed genes, multiple genes involved in cellular lipid and glutathione metabolism showed decreased expression levels in celecoxib pre-treated samples; changes associated with diminished cellular proliferation.  Other observed gene expression changes consistent with reduced proliferation include: altered expression of genes involved in cell adhesion (including collagen, laminin, von Willebrand factor and tenascin C), increased expression of inflammatory modulators (including inerleukin-6, S100 calcium binding protein A8, and several chemokines) and decreased expression of the pro-angiogenic gene, angiogenin.  Celecoxib pre-treatment for 7 days in vivo is associated with alterations in colorectal adenocarcinoma gene expression which are suggestive of diminished cellular proliferation.","Patients undergoing surgical resection of histologically proven primary colorectal adenocarcinomas were consented for participation in the study.  The patients enrolled in this study were randomized to receive either 400 mg celecoxib two times per day (n=11) or no COX-2 inhibitor (n=12) for 7 days prior to surgical resection. Total RNA (5 ug) from each sample was converted to double stranded cDNA using a dT-T7 promoter primer.

We performed a whole-genome RNA profiling of putamen tissue from idiopathic PD (IPD), LRRK2-associated PD (G2019S mutation), neurologically healthy controls and one asymptomatic LRRK2 mutation carrier, by using the Genechip Human Exon 1.0-ST Array. The differentially expressed genes found in IPD revealed an alteration of biological pathways related to long term potentiation (LTP), GABA receptor signalling, and calcium signalling pathways, among others. These pathways are mainly related with cell signalling cascades and synaptic plasticity processes. They were also altered in the asymptomatic LRRK2 mutation carrier but not in the LRRK2-associated PD group. The expression changes seen in IPD might be attributed to an adaptive consequence of a dysfunction in the dopamine transmission. The lack of these altered molecular pathways in LRRK2-associated PD patients suggests that these cases could show a different molecular response to dopamine transmission impairment.","Number of samples analyzed: 14 brain tissue (putamen).

GSE24238,The role of integrins in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-infected monocytes.,"We have established that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection modulates the biology of target primary blood monocytes, allowing HCMV to use monocytes as “vehicles” for its systemic spread.  HCMV infection of monocytes results in rapid induction of PI(3)K and NF-κB activity.  Integrins, which are upstream of the PI(3)K and NF-κB pathways, were shown to be involved in HCMV binding to and entry into fibroblasts, suggesting that receptor-ligand-mediated signaling following viral binding to integrins on monocytes could trigger the functional changes seen in infected monocytes.  We now show that integrin engagement and the activation of the integrin/Src-signaling pathway is essential for the induction of HCMV-infected monocyte motility.  To investigate how integrin engagement by HCMV triggers monocyte motility, we examined the infected monocyte transcriptome and found that the integrin/Src-signaling pathway regulates the expression of paxillin, which is an important signal transducer in the regulation of actin rearrangement during cell adhesion and movement.  Functionally, we observed that paxillin is activated via the integrin/Src-signaling pathway and is required for monocyte motility.  Because motility is intimately connected to cellular cytoskeletal organization, a process that is also important in viral entry, we investigated the role paxillin regulation plays in the process of viral entry of monocytes. New results confirmed that HCMV`s ability to enter target monocytes is significantly inhibited in cells deficient in paxillin expression or that had their integrin/Src/paxillin signaling pathway blocked. From our data, HCMV-cell interactions emerge as an essential trigger for the cellular changes that allow for HCMV entry and hematogenous dissemination.","Monocytes were mock-infected, HCMV-infected, or pretreated with PP2 inhibitor prior to HCMV infection. There were three samples analyzed per individual replicate. Three replicates are included.",,9,GPL8300,0
GSE29449,Global gene expression response to BET inhibition in two cancer cell lines,"The MYC transcription factor is a master regulator of diverse cancer pathways and somatic cell reprogramming. MYC is a compelling therapeutic target that exhibits cancer-specific cellular effects. Pharmacologic inhibition of MYC function has proven challenging due to its numerous modes of forced expression and the difficulty of disrupting protein-DNA interactions. Here we demonstrate the rapid and potent abrogation of MYC gene transcription by representative small molecule bromodomain inhibitors of the BET family of chromatin adaptors. This transcriptional suppression of MYC was observed in the context of the natural, chromosomally translocated, and amplified gene locus. Inhibition of BET bromodomain-promoter interactions and subsequent reduction of MYC transcript and protein levels resulted in G1 arrest and extensive apoptosis in a variety of leukemia and lymphoma cell lines. Exogenous expression of MYC from an artificial promoter that is resistant to BET regulation significantly protected cells from growth suppression by BET inhibitors and revealed that MYC exerts a direct and tight control of key pro-growth and anti-apoptotic target genes. Transcriptional profiling of two cells after 4 and 8 hours of treatment with BET inhibitor shows that both MYC and its targets are strongly down-regulated.  We thus demonstrate that pharmacologic inhibition of MYC is achievable through targeting BET bromodomains, and suggest that such inhibitors may have broad clinical applicability given the widespread pathogenetic role of MYC in cancer.","LP-1, a multiple myeloma cell line, and Raji, a Burkitt lymphoma cell line, were treated with BET inhibitor and an inactive enantiomer for 4 or 8 hours.

GSE95770,Sorafenib promotes graft-versus-leukemia activity in mice and humans through IL-15 production in FLT3-ITD mutant leukemia cells,"Patients relapsing with FLT3-ITD mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) have a one-year-survival below 20%. We  observed that sorafenib increased IL-15 production by FLT3-ITD+-leukemia cells, which synergized with the allogeneic CD8+T-cell response, leading to long-term survival in murine   and humanized FLT3-ITD+AML models. Using IL-15 deficiency in recipient tissues or leukemia cells, IL-15 production upon sorafenib-treatment could be attributed to leukemia cells. Sorafenib treatment-related IL-15 production caused an increase in CD8+CD107a+IFN-γ+ T-cells with features of longevity (Bcl-2high/reduced PD-1-levels), which eradicated leukemia in secondary recipients. Mechanistically, sorafenib reduced ATF4 expression, thereby blocking negative regulation of IRF7-activation, which enhances IL-15 transcription. Consistent with the mouse data, IL-15 and pIRF7 levels increased in leukemic blasts of  FLT3-ITD+AML patients upon sorafenib treatment. Analysis of 130 patients with FLT3-ITD-mutant AML relapsing after allo-HCT showed the highest complete remission-rate and median overall-survival-rate in the sorafenib/donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) group compared to all other groups (chemotherapy, chemotherapy/DLI, sorafenib alone). Our findings indicate that the synergism of DLI and sorafenib is mediated via reduced ATF4 expression, causing activation of the pIRF7/IL-15-axis in leukemia cells. The sorafenib/DLI strategy therefore has the potential for an immune-mediated cure of FLT3-ITD-mutant AML-  relapse, an otherwise fatal complication after allo-HCT.","Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients relapsing after allograft transplantation were extracted three days before and six days after treatment with sorafenib. 4 patients, marked as responders, showed a favorable outcome event after 6 months, while 4 patients. marked as non-responders. did not respond to sorafenib treatment.",,16,GPL23159,0
GSE96762,Comparative transcript profiling of EBNA2 target gene expression in CBF1 proficient and deficient DG75 cells,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection converts resting human B cells into permanently growing lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). The viral Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) plays key role in this process. It preferentially binds to B cell enhancers and establishes a specific viral and cellular gene expression program in LCLs. The cellular DNA binding factor CBF1/CSL serves as a sequence specific chromatin anchor for EBNA2. The ubiquitous expression of this highly conserved protein raises the question whether additional cellular factors might determine EBNA2 chromatin binding selectively in B cells. Here we used CBF1 deficient B cells to identify cellular genes up or downregulated by EBNA2 as well as CBF1 independent EBNA2 chromatin binding sites. Both, CBF1 independent EBNA2 target genes and chromatin binding sites are less frequent than CBF1 dependent EBNA2 functions. CBF1 independent EBNA2 binding sites are highly enriched for EBF1 binding motifs. We show that EBNA2 binds to EBF1 in CBF1 proficient and deficient B cells and requires EBF1 to bind to CBF1 independent binding sites. Our results identify EBF1 as a co-factor of EBNA2 which conveys B cell specificity to EBNA2.",Gene expression profiling of EBNA2 induced target genes by Affymetrix microarrays,,24,GPL16686,0
GSE99967,Identification of a neutrophil-related gene expression signature that distinguishes between adult patients with and without nephritis in active systemic lupus erythematosus,"Both a lack of biomarkers and relatively ineffective treatments constitute impediments to management of lupus nephritis (LN). Here we used gene expression microarrays to contrast the transcriptomic profiles of active SLE patients with and without LN to identify potential biomarkers for LN. RNA isolated from whole peripheral blood of active SLE patients was used for transcriptomic profiling and the data analyzed by linear modeling, with corrections for multiple testing. Results were validated in a second cohort of SLE patients, using NanoString technology. The majority of genes demonstrating altered mRNA abundance between patients with and without LN were neutrophil-related. Findings in the validation cohort confirmed this observation and showed that the levels of gene expression in renal remission were similar to active patients without LN. In secondary analyses, gene expression correlated with disease activity, hematuria and proteinuria, but not renal biopsy changes. As expression levels of the individual genes correlated strongly with each other, a composite neutrophil score was generated by summing all levels before examining additional correlations. There was a modest correlation between the neutrophil score and the blood neutrophil count, which was largely driven by the dose of steroids and not the proportion of low density and/or activated neutrophils. Analysis of longitudinal data revealed no correlation between baseline neutrophil score or changes over the first year of follow-up with subsequent renal flare or treatment outcomes, respectively. The findings argue that although the neutrophil score is associated with LN, its clinical utility as a biomarker may be limited.",Blood samples were collected from 38 patients satisfying 4 or more of the revised 1997 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for SLE and 17 controls recruited from the University Health Network.,,59,GPL21970,0
