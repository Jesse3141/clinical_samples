GSE33658,22,21.0,,21.0,9.0,1.0,"A phase II neoadjuvant trial of anastrozole (A), fulvestrant (F) and gefitinib (I - iressa) in patients with newly diagnosed estrogen receptor positive breast cancer","Endocrine therapy in patients with breast cancer can be limited by the problem of resistance. Preclinical studies suggest that complete blockade of the estrogen receptor (ER) combined with inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) can overcome endocrine resistance. We tested this hypothesis in a phase II neoadjuvant trial of anastrozole and fulvestrant combined with gefitinib in postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed ER-positive breast cancer. After a baseline tumor core biopsy, patients were randomized to receive anastrozole and fulvestrant (AF) or anastrozole, fulvestrant, and gefitinib (AFG) for 3 weeks.  After a second biopsy at 3 weeks, all patients received AFG for 4 months and surgery was done if the tumor was operable. The primary endpoint was best clinical response by RECIST criteria and secondary endpoints were toxicity and change in biomarkers. The study closed after 15 patients were enrolled because of slow accrual. Median patient age was 67 years and median clinical tumor size was 7 cm. Four patients had metastatic disease present. Three patients withdrew before response was assessed. In the remaining twelve patients, there were two complete clinical responses (17%), three partial responses (25%), five had stable disease (41%), and two (17%) had progressive disease. Most common adverse events were rash in four patients, diarrhea in four, joint symptoms in three, and abnormal liver function tests in three. There were no grade 4 toxicities and all toxicities were reversible. At 3 weeks, cell proliferation as measured by Ki-67 was significantly reduced in the AFG group (p value= 0.01) with a parallel reduction in the expression of the Cyclin D1 (p value=0.02). RNA microarray data showed a corresponding decrease in the expression of cell cycle genes. These results suggest that AFG was an effective neoadjuvant therapy and consistently reduced proliferation in ER-positive tumors.","We tested this hypothesis in a phase II neoadjuvant trial of anastrozole and fulvestrant combined with gefitinib in postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed ER-positive breast cancer.

GSE24742,23,21.0,,21.0,0.0,1.0,Effects of Rituximab on global gene expression profiles in the RA synovium,"Objective: Rituximab displays therapeutic benefits in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients resistant to TNF blockade. However, the precise role of B cells in the pathogenesis of RA is still unknown. In this study we investigated the global molecular effects of rituximab in synovial biopsies obtained from anti-TNF resistant RA patients before and after administration of the drug.

Methods: Paired synovial biopsies were obtained from the affected knee of anti-TNF resistant RA patients before (T0) and 12 weeks after initiation of rituximab therapy (T12). Total RNA was extracted, labeled according to standard Affymetrix procedures and hybridized on GeneChip HGU133 Plus 2.0 slides. Immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR experiments were performed to confirm the differential expression of selected transcripts.

Results: According to paired Student’s t-tests, 549 out of 54,675 investigated probe sets were differentially expressed between T0 and T12. Pathway analysis revealed that genes down-regulated between T0 and T12 were significantly enriched in immunoglobulin genes, and genes involved in chemotaxis, leucocyte activation and immune responses (Gene Ontology annotations). By contrast, genes up-regulated between T0 and T12 were significantly enriched in transcripts involved in cell development (Gene Ontology annotation) and wound healing (GSEA). At baseline, higher synovial expression of immunoglobulin genes was associated with response to therapy.

Conclusion: Rituximab displays unique effects on global gene expression profiles in synovial tissue of RA patients. These observations open new perspectives in the understanding of the biological effects of the drug and in the selection of patients likely to benefit from this therapy.","Twenty patients with RA (17 women and 3 men, average age +/- SEM: 52,6+/-3,8 years) were included in the study. All patients met the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for the diagnosis of RA. All patients had active disease at the time of tissue sampling and were resistant to TNF blockade. They all had erosive changes imaged on conventional x-rays of the hands and/or feet. All of them had a swollen knee at inclusion. Rituximab therapy was administrated at a dose of 1,000 mg IV at baseline (T0) and at week 2, together with 125 mg IV Methylprednisolone. Clinical parameters at baseline (T0) and 12 weeks after the initiation of therapy (T12) was evaluated using DAS(28)-CRP scores and clinical responses were assessed using EULAR response criteria. Synovial biopsies were obtained by needle-arthroscopy of an affected knee from all patients at T0 and T12. For each procedure, 4 to 8 synovial samples were kept overnight at 4°C in a RNA stabilizing solution (RNALater, Ambion, Applied Biosystems, TX, USA) and then stored at –80°C for later RNA extraction. The same amount of tissue was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at –80°C for immunostaining experiments on frozen sections. The remaining material was fixed in 10% formaldehyde and paraffin embedded for conventional optical evaluation and immunostaining of selected markers. All the experiments (RNA extraction, histology, immunohistochemistry) were performed on at least 4 biopsies harvested during every procedure in order to correct for variations related to the potential heterogeneous distribution of synovial inflammation. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Université catholique de Louvain and informed consent was obtained from all patients.

At least 1 µg total RNA could be extracted from 12 paired samples at T0 and T12 for further processing.",,24,GPL570,0

The second phase of the MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC-II) project evaluated common practices for developing and validating microarray-based models aimed at predicting toxicological and clinical endpoints. The purposes of the MAQC-II project were to survey approaches in genomic model development  in an attempt to understand sources of variability in prediction performance, and to assess the  influences of endpoint signal strength in data. Thirty-six teams developed classifiers for 13 diverse  endpoints -- some easy, some difficult to predict, from six relatively large training data sets -- three  preclinical (toxicogenomics) and three clinical. By providing the same data sets to many organizations  for analysis, but not restricting their data analysis protocols (DAPs), the project made it possible  to evaluate to what extent, if any, results depend on the team that performs the analysis. These analyses  collectively produced >18,000 models that were challenged by independent and blinded validation sets  generated for MAQC-II. The cross-validated performance estimates for models developed under good  practices are predictive of the blinded validation performance. The achievable prediction performance  is largely determined by the intrinsic predictability of the endpoint, and simple data analysis methods  often perform as well as more complicated approaches. Multiple models of comparable performance can be developed for a given endpoint and the stability of gene lists correlates with endpoint predictability. Importantly, similar conclusions were reached when >12,000 new models were  generated by swapping the original training and validation sets.

Description of six data sets including 13 prediction endpoints:
(Summarized in GSE16716_MAQC-II_Datasets_Overview.pdf attached as supplementary file. For more details, see the MAQC-II main paper and its references for individual dataset.)

The MAQC-II predictive modeling was limited to binary classification problems; therefore, continuous endpoint values such as overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) times were dichotomized using a ""milestone"" cutoff of censor data. Prediction endpoints were chosen to span a wide range of prediction difficulty. Two endpoints, H (CPS1) and L (NEP_S), representing the gender of the patients, were used as positive control endpoints, since they are easily predictable by microarrays. Two other endpoints, I (CPS1) and M (NEP_R), representing randomly assigned class labels, were designed to serve as negative control endpoints, since they are not supposed to be predictable. Data analysis teams were not aware of the characteristics of endpoints H, I, L, and M until their swap prediction results had been submitted. If a data analysis protocol did not yield models to accurately predict endpoints H and L, or if a data analysis protocol claims to be able to yield models to accurately predict endpoints I and M, something must have gone wrong.

The Hamner data set (endpoint A) was provided by The Hamner Institutes for Health Sciences (Research Triangle Park, NC, USA). The study objective was to apply microarray gene expression data from the lung of female B6C3F1 mice exposed to a 13-week treatment of chemicals to predict increased lung tumor incidence in the 2-year rodent cancer bioassays of the National Toxicology Program. If successful, the results may form the basis of a more efficient and economical approach for evaluating the carcinogenic activity of chemicals. Microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays on three to four mice per treatment group, and a total of 70 mice were analyzed and used as the MAQC-II's training set. Additional data from another set of 88 mice were collected later and provided as the MAQC-II's external validation set.

The Iconix data set (endpoint B) was provided by Iconix Biosciences, Inc. (Mountain View, CA, USA). The study objective was to assess, upon short term exposure, hepatic tumor induction by non-genotoxic chemicals, since there are currently no accurate and well-validated short-term tests to identify non-genotoxic hepatic tumorigens, thus necessitating an expensive 2-year rodent bioassay before a risk assessment can begin. The training set consists of hepatic gene expression data from 216 male Sprague-Dawley rats treated for 5 days with one of 76 structurally and mechanistically diverse nongenotoxic hepatocarcinogens and non-hepatocarcinogens. The validation set consists of 201 male Sprague-Dawley rats treated for 5 days with one of 68 structurally and mechanistically diverse non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogens and non- hepatocarcinogens. Gene expression data were generated using the Amersham Codelink Uniset Rat 1 Bioarray (GE HealthCare, Piscataway, NJ). The separation of the training set and validation set was based on the time when the microarray data were collected; i.e., microarrays processed earlier in the study were used as training and those processed later were used as validation.

The NIEHS data set (endpoint C) was provided by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) of the National Institutes of Health (Research Triangle Park, NC, USA). The study objective was to use microarray gene expression data acquired from the liver of rats exposed to hepatotoxicants to build classifiers for prediction of liver necrosis. The gene expression ""compendium"" data set was collected from 418 rats exposed to one of eight compounds (1,2- dichlorobenzene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, bromobenzene, monocrotaline, N-nitrosomorpholine, thioacetamide, galactosamine, and diquat dibromide). All eight compounds were studied using standardized procedures, i.e. a common array platform (Affymetrix Rat 230 2.0 microarray), experimental procedures and data retrieving and analysis processes. Briefly, for each compound,  four to six male, 12 week old F344 rats were exposed to a low dose, mid dose(s) and a high dose  of the toxicant and sacrificed at 6, 24 and 48 hrs later. At necropsy, liver was harvested for  RNA extraction, histopathology, and clinical chemistry assessments.

The human breast cancer (BR) data set (endpoints D and E) was contributed by the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC, Houston, TX, USA). Gene expression data from 230 stage I-III breast cancers were generated from fine needle aspiration specimens of newly diagnosed breast cancers before any therapy. The biopsy specimens were collected sequentially during a prospective pharmacogenomic marker discovery study between 2000 and 2008. These specimens represent 70-90% pure neoplastic cells with minimal stromal contamination. Patients received 6 months of preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy including paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin followed by surgical resection of the cancer. Response to preoperative chemotherapy was categorized as a pathological complete response (pCR = no residual invasive cancer in the breast or lymph nodes) or residual invasive cancer (RD), and used as endpoint D for prediction. Endpoint E is the clinical estrogen-receptor status as established by immunohistochemistry. RNA extraction and gene expression profiling were performed in multiple batches over time using Affymetrix U133A microarrays. Genomic analysis of a subset of this sequentially accrued patient population were reported previously. For each endpoint, the first 130 cases were used as a training set and the next 100 cases were used as an independent validation set.

The multiple myeloma (MM) data set (endpoints F, G, H, and I) was contributed by the Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS, Little Rock, AR, USA). Gene expression profiling of highly purified bone marrow plasma cells was performed in newly diagnosed patients with MM. The training set consisted of 340 cases enrolled on total therapy 2 (TT2) and the validation set comprised 214 patients enrolled in total therapy 3 (TT3). Plasma cells were enriched by anti-CD138 immunomagnetic bead selection of mononuclear cell fractions of bone marrow aspirates in a central laboratory. All samples applied to the microarray contained more than 85% plasma cells as determined by 2-color flow cytometry  (CD38+ and CD45-/dim) performed after selection. Dichotomized overall survival (OS) and eventfree survival (EFS) were determined based on a two-year milestone cutoff. A gene expression model of  high-risk multiple myeloma was developed and validated by the data provider and later on validated in three additional independent data sets.

The neuroblastoma (NB) data set (endpoints J, K, L, and M) was contributed by the Children's Hospital of the University of Cologne, Germany. Tumor samples were checked by a pathologist prior  to RNA isolation; only samples with =60% tumor content were utilized and total RNA was isolated  from ~50mg of snap-frozen neuroblastoma tissue obtained before chemotherapeutic treatment. First, 502 pre-existing 11K Agilent dye-flipped, dual-color replicate profiles for 251 patients were provided. Of these, profiles of 246 neuroblastoma samples passed an independent MAQC-II quality assessment by majority decision and formed the MAQC-II training data set. Subsequently, 514 dyeflipped dual-color 11K replicate profiles for 256 independent neuroblastoma tumor samples were generated and profiles for 253 samples were selected to form the MAQC-II validation set. Of note, for one patient of the validation set, two different tumor samples were analyzed utilizing both versions of the 2x11K microarray (see below). All dual-color gene-expression of the MAQC-II training set were generated using a customized 2x11K neuroblastoma-related microarray. Furthermore, 20 patients of the MAQC-II validation set were also profiled utilizing this microarray. Dual-color profiles of the remaining patients of the MAQC-II validation set were performed using a slightly revised version of the 2x11K microarray. This version V2.0 of the array comprised 200 novel oligonucleotide probes whereas 100 oligonucleotide probes of the original design were removed due to consistent low expression values (near background) observed in the training set profiles. These minor modifications of the microarray design resulted in a total of 9,986 probes present on both versions of the 2x11K microarray. The experimental protocol did not differ between both sets and gene-expression profiles were performed as described. Furthermore, single-color geneexpression profiles were generated for 478/499 neuroblastoma samples of the MAQC-II dual-color training and validation sets (training set 244/246; validation set 234/253). For the remaining 21 samples no single-color data were available, due to either shortage of tumor material of these patients (n=15), poor experimental quality of the generated single-color profiles (n=5), or correlation of one single-color profile to two different dual-color profiles for the one patient profiled with both versions of the 2x11K microarrays (n=1). Single-color gene-expression profiles were generated using customized 4x44K oligonucleotide microarrays produced by Agilent Technologies (Palo Alto, CA, USA). These 4x44K microarrays included all probes represented by Agilent's Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray and all probes of the version V2.0 of the 2x11K customized microarray that were not present in the former probe set. Labeling and hybridization was performed following the manufacturer's protocol as described.

Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples are easy to handle, stable and particularly suitable for morphologic evaluation, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. However, it has become a paradigm that these samples cannot be used for genome-wide expression analysis with microarrays. To oppose this view, we present a pilot microarray study using FFPE core needle biopsies from breast cancers as RNA source.  We found that microarray probes interrogating sequences near the poly-A-tail of the transcribed genes were well suitable to measure RNA levels in FFPE core needle biopsies. For the ER and the HER2 gene, we observed strong correlations between RNA levels measured in these probe sets and protein expression determined by immunohistochemistry (p = 0.000003 and p = 0.0022). Further, we have identified a signature of 364 genes that correlated with ER protein status and a signature of 528 genes that correlated with HER2 protein status. Many of these genes (ER: 60%) could be confirmed by analysis of an independent publicly available data set. Finally, a hierarchical clustering of the biopsies with respect to three recently reported gene expression grade signatures resulted in widely stable low and high expression grade clusters that correlated with the pathological tumor grade.  These findings support the notion that clinically relevant information can be gained from microarray based gene expression profiling of FFPE cancer biopsies. This opens new opportunities for the integration of gene expression analysis into the workflow of invasive cancer diagnostics as well as translational research in the setting of clinical studies.

The goal of this study was the finding of several genes related to apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, survival and transformation-related genes and correlating their differences in expression with the degree of response to chemotherapy, determined by the Miller and Payne histological grading system.","After informed consent, patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer and scheduled chemotherapy treatment based on Anthracyclines and Taxanes (Treatment A: Epirubicin 90 mg/m2-Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, 3 cycles bi-weekly and Paclitaxel 150 mg/m2-Gemcitabine 2500 mg/m2, 6 cycles bi-weekly ± weekly Herceptin 4 mg/Kg during the first week, 2 mg/Kg for the remaining 11 cycles; Treatment B: Doxorubicin 60 mg/m2-Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2, 4 cycles tri-weekly and Docetaxel 100 mg/m2, 4 cycles tri-weekly; Treatment C: Doxorubicin 60 mg/m2-Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, 4 cycles tri-weekly and Docetaxel 100 mg/m2, 4 cycles tri-weekly ) were recruited for this study. Pre-chemotherapy and post-chemotherapy biopsies were examined by a pathologist who determined the Miller & Payne grade for each patient. Matching pairs of pre-chemotherapy and post-chemotherpy samples were divided into 3 groups according to Miller & Payne grade: group of bad response (Miller & Payne grades 1 and 2), group of mid response (Miller & Payne grade 3) and group of good response (Miller & Payne grades 4 and 5). Gene expression analysis was performed in paired samples as follows: mid response group post-chemotherapy biopsy vs pre-chemotherapy biopsy (Mid final vs initial). For this assay were necessary 20 samples being chosen according to histopathologic criteria (Miller & Payne grade 3). Other comparisons in which this group of samples was involved include: Initial Good vs Mid, Initial Bad vs Mid, Final Bad vs Mid and Final Good vs Mid. This gene expression profiling was carried out making use of Affymetrix’s GeneChip technology, with the Affymetrix’s HG-U133 Plus 2.0 array from this provider. All the protocols and apparatus were recommended by Affymetrix. Total RNA from frozen mammary tumors was directly extracted by a RNeasy Mini kit and homogenized by QIAshredder columns under manufacturer’s instructions. The quality and quantity of the obtained RNA, was checked out through agarose electrophoresis and later spectrophotometry at 260/280 nm. Biotinylated cRNA was synthesized following the IVT labeling kit from Affymetrix and purified by the GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module from Affymetrix. Once again, the quality and quantity of the obtained cRNA, was checked out through agarose electrophoresis and posterior spectrophotometry at 260/280 nm. After hybridization, slides were washed and scanned following the manufacturer’s standard protocol. Intensity values were normalized by Robust Multichip Average method and subsequently these were filtered for remove the control sequences and those with a hybridization signal near to background. The spike controls were: BioB, BioC, BioD and Cre; because BioB was the less presented in the samples, it was used to estimate the sensitivity of the experiment. The housekeeping control was GAPDH. After non-supervised PCA analysis and clustering, gene expression statistical significances were identified by two regression models taking into account the pathologic response to chemotherapy and if the sample was obtained before or after chemotherapy treatment. Supervised PCA analysis and clustering were performed with processed data.

We conducted a phase-II study of adding the VEGFR/Ras/Raf/MAPK inhibitor sorafenib to endocrine therapy in metastatic ER-positive breast cancer, either upon progression or after maximal response with measurable residual disease. Tumor biopsies and serum were collected on days 1 and 28. Primary endpoint was response by RECIST after 3 months and secondary endpoints included safety, time to progression (TTP), and biomarker assessment. Planned sample size was 43 patients but the study closed after 11 patients because of slow accrual. 8 patients had progressive disease (PD) on entry and 3 had stable disease (SD). One patient with SD discontinued sorafenib after 2-weeks because of grade 3 rash. Of the 10 remaining patients after adding sorafenib, 7 had SD (70%), 3 had PD (30%) and median TTP was 6.1-months. Of the 8 patients who entered the study with PD on endocrine therapy, 5 converted to SD (62%) with a median TTP of 6.4-months. Notably, patients on tamoxifen had a median TTP of 8.4-months. The most common adverse events were hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, and rash, and the majority were grade 1&2 with no grade 4 toxicities. There was a significant reduction in serum VEGFR2 and PDGFR-α on day-28 (p-values 0.0035 and 0.017, respectively). Both serum VEGF and sVEGFR-1 were increased on day-28, but the differences were not statistically significant (p-values 0.3223 and 0.084, respectively). Microarray analysis identified 32 suppressed genes with an FDR of <0.20 and at least a 2-fold change with no induced genes and 29 KEGG pathways were enriched on day-28.  Our study suggests that sorafenib can restore endocrine sensitivity, particularly tamoxifen, and this strategy of adding novel agents in patients progressing on endocrine therapy should be examined in future trials.","This was a single-institution, phase II study of adding sorafenib to existing endocrine therapy.  On study entry, eligible patients underwent serum sample collection and core biopsy of accessible disease (if applicable) on endocrine therapy and prior to starting sorafenib.  Serum and a second biopsy were then collected on day 28. Sorafenib dose was 400mg orally twice daily along with continuing the same endocrine agent.  Patients were followed monthly for clinical and toxicity evaluation.

Ibrutinib is an oral covalent BTK inhibitor that has shown some efficacy in both indications. To improve ibrutinib efficacy through combination therapy, we first investigated differential gene expression in parental and ibrutinib-resistant cell lines to better understand the mechanisms of resistance. Ibrutinib-resistant TMD8 cells had higher BCL2 gene expression and increased sensitivity to ABT-199, a BCL-2 inhibitor.

We further demonstrated synergistic growth suppression by ibrutinib and ABT-199 in multiple ABC-DLBCL, GCB-DLBCL, and FL lymphoma cell lines. The combination of both drugs also reduced colony formation, increased apoptosis, and inhibited tumor growth in a TMD8 xenograft model.

Keywords:  Lung Cancer Prognosis, Gene Expression Signature, Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded Samples
The goal of this study is to test the feasibility of developing lung cancer prognosis gene signatures using genome-wide expression profiling of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, which are widely available and provide a valuable rich source for studying the association of molecular changes in cancer and associated clinical outcomes. FFPE tumor specimens were collected, and total RNA was processed for analysis on the Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 arrays according to Affymetrix protocols.  The quality control procedure for microarray data analysis was based on the percentage of present calls calculated by the MAS5 package. We selected 55 arrays with at least 15% of probe sets present, and we selected 1400 probe sets that present on all 55 arrays for data analysis. After microarray analysis QC, we used the RMA background correction algorithm to remove non-specific background  noise. A robust regression model was fitted to the probe level data, and the fitted expression values for the probes at the 3' end were used to summarize the probe set expression values.  Quantile-quantile normalization was used to normalize all the arrays. The 55 samples and the derived gene expression values for 1400 genes based on the robust regression model were used to develop gene signatures and were uploaded as supplementary data (GSE29013_fitted_1400_probes.txt).","We micro dissected tumor area from FFPE specimen, and used Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 arrays to obtain gene expression data.",,55,GPL570,0

We posited that a gene expression signature capable of discerning tumors of grade I (G1) and grade III (G3) histology might provide a more objective measure of grade with prognostic benefit for patients with moderately differentiated disease. To this end, we studied the expression profiles of 347 primary invasive breast tumors analyzed on Affymetrix microarrays. Using class prediction algorithms, we identified 264 robust grade-associated markers, six of which could accurately classify G1 and G3 tumors, and separate G2 tumors into two highly discriminant classes (termed G2a and G2b genetic grades) with patient survival outcomes highly similar to those with G1 and G3 histology, respectively. Statistical analysis of conventional clinical variables further distinguished G2a and G2b subtypes from each other, but also from histologic G1 and G3 tumors. In multivariate analyses, genetic grade was consistently found to be an independent prognostic indicator of disease recurrence comparable to that of lymph node status and tumor size. When incorporated into the Nottingham Prognostic Index, genetic grade enhanced detection of patients with less harmful tumors, likely to benefit little from adjuvant therapy. Our findings show that a genetic grade signature can improve prognosis and therapeutic planning for breast cancer patients, and support the view that low and high grade disease, as defined genetically, reflect independent pathobiological entities rather than a continuum of cancer progression. Three separate breast cancer cohorts were analyzed: 1) Uppsala (n=249), 2) Stockholm (n=58), 3) Singapore (n=40). The Uppsala and Singapore data can be accessed here.

To overcome these limitations, we propagated a cohort of human breast tumors grown in the epithelium-free mammary fat pad of SCID/Beige and NOD/SCID/IL2γ-receptor null (NSG) mice, under a series of transplant conditions.  Both models yielded stably transplantable xenografts at comparably high rates (~23% and ~19%, respectively). Of the conditions tested, xenograft take rate was highest in the presence of a low-dose estradiol pellet. Overall, 32 stably transplantable xenograft lines were established, representing unique 25 patients. Most tumors yielding xenografts were “triple-negative” (ER-PR-HER2+) (n=19). However, we established lines from three ER-PR-HER2+ tumors, one ER+PR-HER2-, one ER+PR+HER2- and one “triple-positive” (ER+PR+HER2+) tumor.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the clinical activity and tolerability of multiple doses of SRT2104, a selective activator of SIRT1, in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis after day 84 of treatment. Forty patients were randomized 4:1 to three escalating doses of SRT2104 (250, 500, 1000 mg/d SRT2104 or placebo). Across all SRT2104 groups, 34.6% of patients (9 out of 26; 90% CI 18.0%-54.2%, p<0.0001) achieved good to excellent histological improvement based on skin biopsies taken at baseline and day 84.  To evaluate the changes in expression profile with treatment and to identify pathways involved in histological improvement, a subset of 22 Pre and Post treatment biopsies from 11 patients (4 Placebo, 7 Active Treatment) were hybridized to hgu133plus2 chips. Improvement in histology was associated with modulation of IL-17 and TNF-_ signaling pathways and keratinocyte differentiation target genes. Various studies suggest a crucial role of TNF_ and IL-17 in psoriasis pathogenesis and IL-17/TNF_ synergism induces a strong induction of differentially expressed genes in psoriasis, thus advocating a crucial role of IL-17/TNF_ combination in the molecular basis of disease (Chiricozzi et al., 2010).  In the current study, broad scale gene expression profiling revealed that SRT2104 significantly reduced known IL-17 and TNF_ responsive genes including SERPINB4, S100A12, SERPINB3, kynu etc. even though the sample size for this analysis was small. One of the most highly modulated genes by SRT2104 included Kynu, a gene that regulates tryptophan metabolism, known to confer antibacterial effector functions (Daubener and MacKenzie, 1999). Interestingly kynu is part of the etanercept residual genomic profile that is not modulated by etanercept therapy even though clinical efficacy is achieved. Possibly, SRT2104 may be modulating the lipid barrier of the epidermis of psoriatic skin via modulation of keratinocyte diferentiation genes, which would be consistent with the observed improvement in skin histology. These results indicate a combinatorial effect of SRT2104 on TNF_, and IL-17 inflammatory signaling pathways and keratinocyte differentiation that could be a contributing factor towards improvement in clinical scores by the SIRT1 activator, SRT2104.","Paired  Pre (Day 1) and Post (Day 84) Treatment samples were obtained from 4 Placebo Patients and 7 patients treated with SRT2104 at 3 different doses (250, 500, 1000 mg).",,22,GPL570,0

So far, the value of these multi-gene signatures in clinical practice is unclear and the biological importance of individual genes is difficult to assess as the published signatures virtually do not overlap.

Methods: Here we describe a novel single institute cohort, including 196 non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) cases with clinical information and long-term follow-up, which was used as a training set to screen for single genes with prognostic impact. The top 450 gene probe sets identified using a univariate Cox regression model (significance level p<0.01) were tested in a meta-analysis including five publicly available independent lung cancer cohorts (n=860).

Results: The meta-analysis revealed that 17 probe sets were significantly associated with survival (p<0.0005) with a false discovery rate of 1%. The prognostic impact of one of these genes, the cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1), was confirmed by use of immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray including 355 NSCLC samples. Low CADM1 protein expression was associated with shorter survival (p=0.028), with particular influence in the adenocarcinoma patient subgroup (p=0.002).

To provide insights into the biology of pPCL, we have investigated the transcriptional profiles of a cohort of 21 newly-diagnosed, homogeneously treated pPCL patients included in a multicenter prospective clinical trial. All but one pPCL had one of the main IGH translocations, whose associated transcriptional signatures resembled those observed in MM.

The transcriptional pattern of the pPCL series was then evaluated in association with outcome. Three genes were identified having expression levels correlated with response to the first-line treatment with lenalidomide/dexamethasone, whereas a 27-gene signature was identified associated with overall survival independently of molecular alterations, hematological parameters and renal function.

This study was conducted to determine if the same processes are relevant to celecoxib’s effects on human colorectal adenocarcinomas treated in vivo.  A cohort of 23 patients with primary colorectal adenocarcinomas was randomized to receive a 7-day course of celecoxib (400 mg b.i.d.) or no drug prior to surgical resection.  Gene expression profiling was performed on resected adenocarcinomas from patients with and without celecoxib pre-treatment.  Using fold change (>1.5) and p-value (<0.05) cut-offs, 190 genes were differentially expressed between adenocarcinomas from patients receiving celecoxib and those that did not.  Of the differentially expressed genes, multiple genes involved in cellular lipid and glutathione metabolism showed decreased expression levels in celecoxib pre-treated samples; changes associated with diminished cellular proliferation.  Other observed gene expression changes consistent with reduced proliferation include: altered expression of genes involved in cell adhesion (including collagen, laminin, von Willebrand factor and tenascin C), increased expression of inflammatory modulators (including inerleukin-6, S100 calcium binding protein A8, and several chemokines) and decreased expression of the pro-angiogenic gene, angiogenin.  Celecoxib pre-treatment for 7 days in vivo is associated with alterations in colorectal adenocarcinoma gene expression which are suggestive of diminished cellular proliferation.","Patients undergoing surgical resection of histologically proven primary colorectal adenocarcinomas were consented for participation in the study.  The patients enrolled in this study were randomized to receive either 400 mg celecoxib two times per day (n=11) or no COX-2 inhibitor (n=12) for 7 days prior to surgical resection. Total RNA (5 ug) from each sample was converted to double stranded cDNA using a dT-T7 promoter primer.  The double stranded cDNA was then used as a template to synthesize biotinylated RNA, which was fragmented and hybridized to the Affymetrix HG_U95av2 microarray chip using Affymetrix’s labeling and hybridization protocol.",,23,GPL8300,0

We hypothesized that a previously published 368-gene expression signature associated with MBC might serve to define a prognostic classifier in basal cancers. We collected public gene expression and histoclinical data of 2145 invasive early breast adenocarcinomas. We developed a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier based on this 368-gene list in a learning set, and tested its predictive performances in an independent validation set. Then, we assessed its prognostic value and that of six prognostic signatures for disease-free survival (DFS) in the remaining 2034 samples. The SVM model accurately classified all MBC samples in the learning and validation sets. A total of 466 cases were basal across other sets. The SVM classifier separated them into two subgroups, subgroup 1 (resembling MBC) and subgroup 2 (not resembling MBC). Subgroup 1 exhibited 71% 5-year DFS, whereas subgroup 2 exhibited 50% (p=9.93E-05). The classifier outperformed the classical prognostic variables in multivariate analysis, conferring lesser risk for relapse in subgroup 1 (HR=0.52, p=3.9E-04).

With an extremely poor five-year survival rate of only 15%, identification of new therapeutic targets for EAC is of great importance. Here, we analyze the mutation spectra from the whole exome sequencing of 149 EAC tumors/normal pairs, 15 of which have also been subjected to whole genome sequencing. We identify a novel mutational signature in EACs defined by a high prevalence of A to C transversions at Ap*A dinucleotides. Statistical analysis of the exome data identified 26 genes that are mutated at a significant frequency. Of these 26 genes, only four (TP53, CDKN2A, SMAD4, and PIK3CA) have been previously implicated in EAC. The novel significantly mutated genes include several chromatin modifying factors and candidate contributors to EAC: SPG20, TLR4, ELMO1, and DOCK2.   Notably, functional analyses of EAC-derived mutations in ELMO1 increase cellular invasion. Therefore, we suggest a new hypothesis about the potential activation of the RAC1 pathway to be a contributor to EAC tumorigenesis.","The study aimed to analyze 150 primary, human esophageal adenocarcinoma samples by whole genome and whole exome sequencing (which will be deposited to dbGAP following the TCGA practice).

Here we used gene expression microarrays to contrast the transcriptomic profiles of active SLE patients with and without LN to identify potential biomarkers for LN. RNA isolated from whole peripheral blood of active SLE patients was used for transcriptomic profiling and the data analyzed by linear modeling, with corrections for multiple testing. Results were validated in a second cohort of SLE patients, using NanoString technology. The majority of genes demonstrating altered mRNA abundance between patients with and without LN were neutrophil-related. Findings in the validation cohort confirmed this observation and showed that the levels of gene expression in renal remission were similar to active patients without LN. In secondary analyses, gene expression correlated with disease activity, hematuria and proteinuria, but not renal biopsy changes. As expression levels of the individual genes correlated strongly with each other, a composite neutrophil score was generated by summing all levels before examining additional correlations. There was a modest correlation between the neutrophil score and the blood neutrophil count, which was largely driven by the dose of steroids and not the proportion of low density and/or activated neutrophils. Analysis of longitudinal data revealed no correlation between baseline neutrophil score or changes over the first year of follow-up with subsequent renal flare or treatment outcomes, respectively.

Here, we aim to investigate the ability of the GGI to predict relapses in postmenopausal women who were treated with tamoxifen (T) or letrozole (L) within the BIG 1-98 trial. 
Methods: We generated gene expression profiles (Affymetrix) and computed the GGI for a matched, case-control sample of patients enrolled in the BIG 1-98 trial from the two hospitals where frozen samples were available. All relapses (cases) were identified from patients randomized to receive monotherapy or from the switching treatment arms for whom relapse occurred before the switch.  Each case was randomly matched with four controls based upon nodal status and treatment (T or L).  The prognostic value of GGI was assessed as a continuous predictor and divided at the median.  Predictive accuracy of GGI was estimated using time-dependent area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curves. 
Results:  Frozen samples were analyzable for 48 patients (10 cases and 38 controls).  Seven of the 10 cases had been assigned to receive L. Cases and controls were comparable with respect to menopausal and nodal status, local and chemotherapy, and HER2 positivity. Cases were slightly older than controls and had a larger proportion of large, poorly differentiated ER+/PgR- tumors.  The GGI was significantly and linearly related to risk of relapse: each 10-unit increase in GGI resulted in an increase of approximately 11% in the hazard rate (p=0.02).  Within the subgroups of patients with node-positive disease or who were treated with L, the hazard of relapse was significantly greater for patients with GGI at or above the median. AUC reached a maximum of 78% at 27 months.
Conclusions: This analysis supports the GGI as a good predictor of relapse for ER-positive patients, even among patients who receive L.  Validation of these results, in a larger series from BIG 1-98, is planned using the simplified GGI represented by a smaller set of genes and tested by qRT-PCR on paraffin-embedded tissues.

Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are clinically heterogeneous, and prognostic markers and biology-based therapies are needed to better treat this disease.

We assembled Affymetrix gene expression data for 579 TNBCs and performed unsupervised analysis to define metagenes that distinguish molecular subsets within TNBC. We used n=394 cases for discovery and n=185 cases for validation. Sixteen metagenes emerged that identified basal-like, apocrine and claudin-low molecular subtypes, or reflected various non-neoplastic cell populations including immune cells, blood, adipocytes, stroma, angiogenesis, and inflammation within the cancer. The expressions of these metagenes were correlated with survival and multivariate analysis was performed including routine clinical and pathological variables.

73% of TNBCs displayed basal-like molecular subtype that correlated with high histological grade and younger age. Survival of basal-like TNBC was not different from non-basal-like TNBC. High expression of immune cell metagenes was associated with good and high expression of inflammation and angiogenesis-related metagenes were associated with poor prognosis. A ratio of high B-cell and low IL-8 metagenes identified 32% of TNBC with good prognosis (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22-0.61; P<0.001) and was the only significant predictor in multivariate analysis including routine clincopathological variables.

We show that genomic analysis of acquired resistance to MAPK inhibitors revealed key driver genes but failedto adequately account for clinical resistance. From a large-scale comparative analysis of temporal transcriptomes from patient-matched tumor biopsies, we discovered highly recurrent differential expression and signature outputs of c-MET, LEF1 and YAP1 as drivers of acquired MAPK inhibitor resistance. Moreover, integration of gene- and signature-based transcriptomic analysis revealed profound CD8 T cell deficiency detected in half of resistant melanomas in association with downregulation of dendritic cells and antigen presentation. We also propose a major methylomic basis to transcriptomic evolution under MAPK inhibitor selection. Thus, this database provides a rich informational resource, and the current landscape represents a benchmark to understanding melanoma therapeutic resistance.",Melanoma biopsies pre and post MAPKi treatment were sent for transcriptomic analysis using Affymetrix HuGene 2.1 microarray,SubSeries of: GSE65186,4,GPL17692,0
GSE95770,16,4.0,,4.0,9.0,0.0,Sorafenib promotes graft-versus-leukemia activity in mice and humans through IL-15 production in FLT3-ITD mutant leukemia cells,"Patients relapsing with FLT3-ITD mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) have a one-year-survival below 20%. We  observed that sorafenib increased IL-15 production by FLT3-ITD+-leukemia cells, which synergized with the allogeneic CD8+T-cell response, leading to long-term survival in murine   and humanized FLT3-ITD+AML models. Using IL-15 deficiency in recipient tissues or leukemia cells, IL-15 production upon sorafenib-treatment could be attributed to leukemia cells. Sorafenib treatment-related IL-15 production caused an increase in CD8+CD107a+IFN-γ+ T-cells with features of longevity (Bcl-2high/reduced PD-1-levels), which eradicated leukemia in secondary recipients. Mechanistically, sorafenib reduced ATF4 expression, thereby blocking negative regulation of IRF7-activation, which enhances IL-15 transcription. Consistent with the mouse data, IL-15 and pIRF7 levels increased in leukemic blasts of  FLT3-ITD+AML patients upon sorafenib treatment. Analysis of 130 patients with FLT3-ITD-mutant AML relapsing after allo-HCT showed the highest complete remission-rate and median overall-survival-rate in the sorafenib/donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) group compared to all other groups (chemotherapy, chemotherapy/DLI, sorafenib alone). Our findings indicate that the synergism of DLI and sorafenib is mediated via reduced ATF4 expression, causing activation of the pIRF7/IL-15-axis in leukemia cells. The sorafenib/DLI strategy therefore has the potential for an immune-mediated cure of FLT3-ITD-mutant AML-  relapse, an otherwise fatal complication after allo-HCT.","Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients relapsing after allograft transplantation were extracted three days before and six days after treatment with sorafenib. 4 patients, marked as responders, showed a favorable outcome event after 6 months, while 4 patients. marked as non-responders. did not respond to sorafenib treatment.",,16,GPL23159,0

We compared the molecular portraits of 63 IBC and 134 non-IBC (nIBC) clinical samples. Genomic imbalances of 49 IBCs and 124 nIBCs were determined using high-resolution array-comparative genomic hybridization, and mRNA expression profiles of 197 samples using whole-genome microarrays. Genomic profiles of IBCs were as heterogeneous as those of nIBCs, and globally relatively close. However, IBCs showed more frequent “complex” patterns and a higher percentage of genes with CNAs per sample. The number of altered regions was similar in both types, although some regions were altered more frequently and/or with higher amplitude in IBCs. Many genes were similarly altered in both types; however, more genes displayed recurrent amplifications in IBCs.","Pre-treatment tumor tissues were collected from 197 patients with invasive adenocarcinomas. Patients underwent surgical biopsies or initial surgery at the Institut Paoli-Calmettes (IPC, Marseille, France) between 1987 and 2007. Each patient gave written informed consent and the study was approved by the IPC “Comité d’Orientation Stratégique”. Tumor samples were macrodissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen within 30 minutes of removal. Before RNA extraction, tumor sections were reviewed by two pathologists and contained more than 60% of tumor cells.

Despite heterogeneous dynamics of clinical tumor regression, residual tumors displayed highly recurrent transcriptomic alterations and enriched processes, which were also observed in MAPKi-selected cell lines (implying tumor cell-intrinsic reprogramming) or in bulk mouse tumors (and the CD45-negative or -positive fractions,, implying tumor cell-intrinsic or stromal/immune alterations, respectively). Tumor cell-intrinsic reprogramming attenuated MAPK-dependency, while enhancing mesenchymal, angiogenic and IFN-inflammatory features and growth/survival dependence on multi-RTKs and PD-L2. In the immune compartment, PD-L2 upregulation in CD11c+ immunocytes drove the loss of T-cell inflammation and promoted BRAFi resistance. Thus, residual melanoma early on MAPKi therapy already displays potentially exploitable adaptive transcriptomic, epigenomic, immune-regulomic alterations.",Melanoma biopsies pre and on MAPKi treatment were sent for transcriptomic analysis using Affymetrix HuGene 1.0 microarray,SubSeries of: GSE75313,6,GPL6244,0

For tumors originating in supra- or infratentorial location different molecular background was suggested but plausible correlations between transcriptional profile and radiological features and/or clinical course are still undefined. The purpose of this study was to identify gene expression profiles related to the most frequent locations of this tumor, subtypes based on various radiological features and clinical pattern of the disease.   According to the radiological features presented on MRI, all cases were divided into four subtypes: solid or mainly solid, cystic with an enhancing cyst wall, cystic with a non-enhancing cyst wall and solid with central necrosis. Bioinformatic analyses showed that gene expression profile of pilocytic astrocytoma highly depends on the tumor location. Most prominent differences were noted for IRX2, PAX3, CXCL14, LHX2, SIX6, CNTN1 and SIX1 genes expression which could distinguish pilocytic astrocytomas of different location even within supratentorial region. Analysis of the genes potentially associated between radiological features showed much weaker transcriptome differences. Single genes showed association with the tendency to progression.   Here we showed that pilocytic astrocytomas of three different locations could be precisely differentiated on the basis of gene expression level but their transcriptional profiles did not strongly reflect the radiological appearance of the tumor or the course of the disease.","Gene expression profiling was performed in 47 pilocytic astrocytoma tumours characterized by different localization, radiology and progression.",,47,GPL570,0

Background: Thalidomide represents a promising immunomodulatory drug that targets both leukemia cells and the tumor microenvironment.
Methods: We treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients with a combined thalidomide/fludarabine regimen and monitored cellular and molecular changes induced by thalidomide in-vivo prior to fludarabine treatment. Thalidomide was given daily (100mg p.o./day) and fludarabine was administered on days 7-11 (25 mg/m² i.v./day) within each 4-week cycle (maximum of 6 cycles). Twenty patients received thalidomide/fludarabine as first line therapy and 20 patients were previously treated. Unmutated IgVH mutation status was found in 36 cases and 13 had high-risk cytogenetic aberrations (deletion of 17p13 or 11q22-q23).
Results: The overall response rate was 80% and 25% for untreated and previously treated patients, respectively. While thalidomide effectively reduced the number of CLL cells, the number of CD3 lymphocytes showed no significant change, but the number of CD4+CD25hiFOXP3+ T-regulatory cells was significantly decreased. Gene expression profiling revealed a thalidomide induced signature containing both targets known to play a role in immunomodulatory drug action as well as novel candidate genes.
Conclusions: Combined thalidomide/fludarabine therapy demonstrated efficacy in high-risk CLL patients. Furthermore, our study provides novel biological insights into thalidomide effect, which might act by enhancing apoptosis of CLL cells and reducing Tregs, thereby enabling T-cell dependent anti-tumor effect.","Patients (""preTHAL"") received thalidomide (100mg p.o./day) starting at day 0 and at day 7 Fludarabine therapy was added to the therapy. To evaluate the in-vivo influence of thalidomide on the transcriptome in CLL, paired GEP was performed in 20 cases at treatment start at day 0 (preTHAL) and prior to fludarabine treatment at day 7 (postTHAL) using HumanGenome U133 Plus2.0 Arrays according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Affymetrix; RNA was isolated from peripheral blood samples enriched for leukemic cells by Ficoll-density gradient centrifugation, percentage of leukemic cells > 90%).

Gene expression profiling employing Affymetrix GeneChips (U133A) was performed in 220 mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas, including a core group of eight Burkitt lymphomas, which fulfilled all diagnostic criteria of the WHO classification. A molecular signature of Burkitt lymphoma was generated. Chromosomal abnormalities were detected by interphase fluorescence in-situ hybridization and array comparative genomic hybridization. The molecular Burkitt lymphoma signature identified 44 cases. Fifteen of these cases lacked a morphology typical for Burkitt/Burkitt-like lymphoma. The vast majority (88%) of the 176 lymphomas without the molecular Burkitt lymphoma signature represented diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. In 20% of these cases a MYC break was detectable which was associated with complex chromosomal changes. Our molecular definition of Burkitt lymphoma sharpens and extends the spectrum of Burkitt lymphoma. In mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas without a Burkitt lymphoma signature, a chromosomal break in the MYC locus proved to be associated with adverse clinical outcome.

Eight cases (8 of 57; 14%) presented aTP53 mutation, all being amplifiers. Unsupervised analysis of gene expression profiles of 26 of the 57 DCIS showed that luminal and ERBB2-amplified, ER-negative cases clustered separately.We further investigated the effect of high and low copy number changes on gene expression. Strikingly, amplicons but also low copy number changes especially on 1q, 8q, and 16q in DCIS regulated the expression of a subset of genes in a very similar way to that recently described in invasive ductal carcinomas.

Glucocorticoids (GCs) cause apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in lymphoid cells and constitute a central component in the therapy of lymphoid malignancies, most notably childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PFKFB2 (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase-2), a kinase controlling glucose metabolism, was identified by us previously as GC response gene in expression profiling analyses performed in children with ALL during initial systemic GC mono-therapy. Since deregulation of glucose metabolism has been implicated in apoptosis induction, this gene and its relatives PFKFB1, 3, and 4 were further analyzed. Expression analyses in additional ALL children, non-leukemic individuals and leukemic cell lines confirmed frequent PFKFB2 induction by GC in most systems sensitive to GC-induced apoptosis, particularly in T-ALL cells. The 3 other family members, in contrast, were not or weakly expressed (PFKFB1 and 4) or not induced by GC (PFKFB3). Conditional PFKFB2 over-expression in the CCRF-CEM T-ALL in vitro model revealed that its 2 splice variants (15A and 15B) did not have any detectable effect on survival or cell cycle progression. Moreover, neither PFKFB2 splice variant significantly affected sensitivity to, or kinetics of, GC-induced apoptosis. Our data suggest that, at least in the model system investigated, PFKFB2 is not an essential upstream regulator of the anti-leukemic effects of GC.
Generation of the GC sensitive and resistant clones is described in Parson et al. FASEB J 2005 (Pubmed id 15637111). In brief GC sensitive clones were generated by limiting dilution subcloning from the GC sensitive T-ALL cell line CCRF-CEM-C7H2. To generate GC resistant clones the CCRF-CEM-C7H2 cell line was clutured in the presence of 10E-7 M dexametasone.",Gene expression profiles of glucocorticoid (GC) resistant and sensitive T-ALL cells during GC treatment and corresponding control samples (cells treated with carrier control).
